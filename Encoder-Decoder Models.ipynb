A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \\\"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\\\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \\\"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\\\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \\\"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\\\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \\\"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\\\" Any additional funds raised will be \\\"paid forward\\\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\",\n          \"(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \\\"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\\\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \\\"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\\\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \\\"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\\\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \\\"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\\\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \\\"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\\\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \\\"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\\\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \\\"strongly\\\" disagreed with the court's decision. \\\"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\\\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \\\"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\\\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \\\"Palestine.\\\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \\\"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\\\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead.

pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field  only to survive Thats according to Washington State University where the dog  a friendly whiteandblack bully breed mix now named Theia  has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Four days after her apparent death the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm dirtcovered and emaciated where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help She was taken in by Moses Lake Washington resident Sara Mellado Considering everything that shes been through shes incredibly gentle and loving Mellado said according to WSU News Shes a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life Theia is only one year old but the dogs brush with death did not leave her unscathed She suffered a dislocated jaw leg injuries and a cavedin sinus cavity  and still requires surgery to help her breathe The veterinary hospitals Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dogs treatment but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dogs care Shes also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated Donors have already surpassed the 10000 target inspired by Theias tale of survival against the odds On the fundraising page Mellado writes She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs Mellado adds and wants to make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again Any additional funds raised will be paid forward to help other animals Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks A cat in Tampa Florida found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January showed up alive in a neighbors yard five days after he was buried by his owner The cat was in bad shape with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society\",\n          \"The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague in the Netherlands where the court is based The Palestinians signed the ICCs founding Rome Statute in January when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem since June 13 2014 Later that month the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis As members of the court Palestinians may be subject to countercharges as well Israel and the United States neither of which is an ICC member opposed the Palestinians efforts to join the body But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad alMalki speaking at Wednesdays ceremony said it was a move toward greater justice As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice he said according to an ICC news release Indeed today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace Judge Kuniko Ozaki a vice president of the ICC said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute These are substantive commitments which cannot be taken lightly she said Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure and countries that support universal acceptance of the courts treaty should speak out to welcome its membership said Balkees Jarrah international justice counsel for the group Whats objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice not Palestines decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members In January when the preliminary ICC examination was opened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage saying the court was overstepping its boundaries The United States also said it strongly disagreed with the courts decision As we have said repeatedly we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC the State Department said in a statement It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as Palestine While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2000 people dead The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June The

survive Thats according to Washington State University where the dog  a friendly whiteandblack bully breed mix now named Theia  has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Four days after her apparent death the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm dirtcovered and emaciated where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help She was taken in by Moses Lake Washington resident Sara Mellado Considering everything that shes been through shes incredibly gentle and loving Mellado said according to WSU News Shes a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life Theia is only one year old but the dogs brush with death did not leave her unscathed She suffered a dislocated jaw leg injuries and a cavedin sinus cavity  and still requires surgery to help her breathe The veterinary hospitals Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dogs treatment but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dogs care Shes also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated Donors have already surpassed the 10000 target inspired by Theias tale of survival against the odds On the fundraising page Mellado writes She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs Mellado adds and wants to make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again Any additional funds raised will be paid forward to help other animals Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks A cat in Tampa Florida found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January showed up alive in a neighbors yard five days after he was buried by his owner The cat was in bad shape with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society\",\n          \"The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague in the Netherlands where the court is based The Palestinians signed the ICCs founding Rome Statute in January when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem since June 13 2014 Later that month the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis As members of the court Palestinians may be subject to countercharges as well Israel and the United States neither of which is an ICC member opposed the Palestinians efforts to join the body But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad alMalki speaking at Wednesdays ceremony said it was a move toward greater justice As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice he said according to an ICC news release Indeed today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace Judge Kuniko Ozaki a vice president of the ICC said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute These are substantive commitments which cannot be taken lightly she said Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure and countries that support universal acceptance of the courts treaty should speak out to welcome its membership said Balkees Jarrah international justice counsel for the group Whats objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice not Palestines decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members In January when the preliminary ICC examination was opened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage saying the court was overstepping its boundaries The United States also said it strongly disagreed with the courts decision As we have said repeatedly we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC the State Department said in a statement It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as Palestine While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2000 people dead The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June The
