One day, I was coming out of a back bend \\u2014 ustrasana, or camel pose, to be exact \\u2014 when my bodymind abruptly and briefly fluttered into a tingling otherworld of uncanny and dizzying bliss. After the class, I asked the teacher about the experience, curious about how he\\u2019d parse my trippy little altered state. \\u2018Probably low blood pressure,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Coming out of backbends can restrict your blood flow. You might want to watch that.\\u2019 I paused. \\u2018This wasn\\u2019t just a head rush. It was like, uh \\u2026 have you ever had a big balloon of nitrous oxide?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 he said, and launched into telling me about the nadis. \\u2018These are channels in the body that carry prana,\\u2019 he explained, referring to Hinduism\\u2019s version of \\u00e9lan vital. \\u2018They are the cause of a lot of openings.\\u2019 At the time I was struck by the fluid ease with which my teacher switched from Western physiology to Eastern esotericism. It spoke to how we postmoderns have grown comfortable shifting between different, even contradictory world views. But it also said something about the contemporary world of postural yoga, and how it has come to bridge (and occasionally tunnel between) the sacred and the secular. Sometimes yoga practitioners set these two frames of reference alongside one another, as my teacher did; other times they superimpose them onto various squirrely frameworks of \\u2018spiritual science\\u2019. For some, asana is unquestionably prayer; for others, it just beats the gym. Yoga\\u2019s special trick is to elude these apparent contradictions by inviting folks to shut up, get on the mat, and follow the flow. \\u2018Yoga is 99 per cent practice, and one per cent theory,\\u2019 proclaimed the late Indian yoga master Sri Krishna Pattabhi Jois, who founded the vigorous style of yoga known as Ashtanga, in Mysore, in 1948.\\u2018Practise, and all is coming.\\u2019 One thing that Jois probably did not see coming, however, was the conscription of yoga into America\\u2019s culture wars. As I write, a public school district in California is being sued by Christian parents and a conservative legal watchdog group for teaching yoga to children aged six to 11 as part of their physical education programme in elementary school. The suit argues that the programme is \\u2018inherently and pervasively religious\\u2019 and, as such, that it violates the state\\u2019s religious freedom clauses. The mediating ambiguity of yoga\\u2019s \\u2018sacred science\\u2019 is being forced through the binary, yes-or-no code of a legal system charged with safeguarding the US\\u2019s constitutional separation between church and state. They complained about the ostracism of children who opted out of the programme \\u2014 a situation one fool compared to Nazi Germany Jois would have been particularly struck by the location of the battle. Encinitas, a small beach community north of San Diego, was the inaugural American home of Ashtanga in the mid-1970s. Developed from the teachings of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the fountainhead of modern Hatha yoga, Jois\\u2019s rigorous Ashtanga school invites practitioners to submit to an unwavering sequence of gnarly poses and taxing transition moves. Though there is little overt discussion of Hindu philosophy in typical Ashtanga studios, the form itself engenders and radiates an unmistakable quality of spiritual discipline and meditative focus. Ashtangis practise most mornings in nearly silent rooms, progressing through the sequence of asanas at an individual pace, while often developing a quality of sober devotion that, while not always easy to distinguish from Type-A obsession, attests to the psychological as well as physically transformative effects of the regimen. One person whose life and body were transformed by Ashtanga is the Australian model Sonia Jones, wife of the American multi-billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II. Following the death of Jois, Sonia \\u2014 to the grumbling of some long-term practitioners \\u2014 entered into a partnership with Jois\\u2019s heir-apparent, his grandson Sharath. What emerged is \\u2018Jois Yoga\\u2019, a codification of the Ashtanga brand, accompanied by a new line of yoga wear. Jones and the Jois family have also established a handful of slick Jois Yoga shalas, or studios, around the US \\u2014 including a new location in Encinitas that some old hands see as a slap in the face to the old-school Ashtanga studio that had been in town since the 1970s. The Joneses meanwhile established the non-profit K P Jois Foundation, which has already provided millions to set up the Contemplative Sciences Center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The foundation also funnelled $533,000 into setting up twice-weekly, 30-minute yoga programmes for elementary schools in the Encinitas Union School District (EUSD). But the programme stuck in the craw of some parents and in October a small number of them \\u2014 evangelical Christians, backed by the conservative National Center for Law and Policy (NCLP) \\u2014 came before the school board. They complained about the use of the Buddhist mandala symbol in art class, the introduction of physical poses \\u2018imparted by Hindu deities\\u2019, and the ostracism of children who opted out of the programme \\u2014 a situation one fool compared to Nazi Germany. The school board, puzzled by this religious interpretation of stretching exercises, and no doubt enjoying the bounty of external funding, refused to cave in. So in February, the NCLP filed a suit against the district on behalf of one pair of parents, Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock. That\\u2019s not how these court battles usually go \\u2014 even in California, whose New Age-friendly coast is pocketed with mega-churches and fiercely conservative communities, especially in the interior of the state. When the issue of religion and public schools comes up, it\\u2019s generally because evangelical activists are trying to slip religious messages into public school, with atheists and freethinking parents invoking the First Amendment. In Encinitas, the tables are turned: now the Biblical conservatives are thumping on the very same secular cornerstone they are more usually trying to slip around. As the journalist Katherine Stewart pointed out in a sharp post on Religion Dispatches, the head attorney at NCLP acting for the Sedlocks \\u2014 Dean Broyles \\u2014 is affiliated with a powerful right-wing legal organisation called the Alliance Defending Freedom. The ADF litigates on behalf of evangelical activity in public schools, which includes abstinence programs, \\u2018character education\\u2019 curricula, and after-school bible study groups for elementary pupils, called Good News Clubs. Stewart, who has written a book about the use of public schools to advance a fundamentalist Christian agenda, noted that all of the schools in the Encinitas district already host Good News Clubs, which gives you a taste of how much religion \\u2014 Christian religion that is, or at least Christian moralising \\u2014 already exists in or around public schooling. The Encinitas case is a different kettle of loaves and fishes. Rather than combating secularism, activist Christians are now indirectly taking on another religion, a religion that, they argue, is disguised as secular physical culture, and is, in their terms at least, false. This battle is not just taking place in the courtroom: it is a war of the religious imagination. In January, National Public Radio covered the controversy. Its report featured Mary Eady, an Encinitas parent, convinced that Hindu religious goals were being inculcated alongside the stretching moves. Eady complained that immediately before performing the sun salutes that so often open yoga routines, pupils were told \\u2018to thank the sun for their lives and the warmth that it brought\\u2019. Most parents (and readers) would barely register this innocuous story-book sentiment. But Eady, deploying the sort of paranoid hermeneutics that fire evangelical worries against product labels or \\u2018backwards-masked\\u2019 messages in rock music, believes that children were being told to worship the sun. Moreover, Eady suggested that behind the program lurked a shadowy, hedge-fund-backed foundation whose founders believe in the spiritual benefits of Ashtanga yoga. But let us reverse the mirror, and ask what sort of religion lurks behind Eady\\u2019s complaints, and what shadowy religious organisations might stand behind her concerns that children are being lured into sun worship? As the yoga writer Carol Horton noted in a blog from February, Eady happens to be a project manager at truthXchange, an evangelical organisation whose raison d\\u2019etre is to halt the spread of \\u2018global paganism\\u2019. The organisation\\u2019s worldview, to judge from their website, is blunt and Manichaean: the choice we face is between the idolatrous worship of the universe itself (\\u2018One-ism\\u2019) or the proper worship of the creator outside the universe (\\u2018Two-ism\\u2019). One important corollary to this formula is that both the \\u2018pagan\\u2019 (and presumably \\u2018Hindu\\u2019) worship of natural forces and science\\u2019s insistence on a purely material cosmos are two sides of the same hell-bent coin. As such, yoga\\u2019s already precarious mediation between sacred and secular, body and mind, simply makes the practice even more suspicious. Even goals such as \\u2018wellbeing\\u2019 and \\u2018stress management\\u2019 can become red flags. \\u2018It\\u2019s stated in the curriculum that [yoga is] meant to shape the way that they view the world,\\u2019 Eady told NPR. \\u2018It\\u2019s meant to shape the way that they regulate their emotions and the way that they view themselves.\\u2019 In the face of such overripe suspicions, the school board, along with representatives from the K P Jois Foundation, have insisted that the yoga program is a purely athletic regimen shorn of religious elements. The majority of press reactions and op-eds adopt a similar line, scoffing at evangelical worries about touching your toes. In a superficially secular society like the US, officially beholden to science, these reactions make sense. Most casual yoga practitioners would be taken aback by the accusation that participation in mindful stretching routines makes them acolytes of an exotic faith. Ironically, the judge in the case turned out to be one such practitioner. Surprising the courtroom by announcing last month that he had recently begun practising Bikram (\\u2018sweaty\\u2019) yoga, Judge John Meyer noted that: \\u2018If you think there\\u2019s something spiritual about what I do, that\\u2019s news to me.\\u2019 American asana practice has been oscillating between the ashram and the gym, sometimes clothed in exotic veils and other times in low-cut spandex Many yogis would understand the judge\\u2019s puzzlement, since Bikram yoga, with its mirror-lined studios and trademarked sequence, is often cast as the epitome of profane and commercialised yoga. For countless practitioners, modern yoga is purely this-worldly, at most lending a holistic sheen to the consumer quest for a better butt. But yoga can be, and quite often is, something more. Many teachers \\u2014 far too many, I feel \\u2014 lace their chat with New Age nostrums, and the d\\u00e9cor in lots of studios suggests a vaguely exotic, mystic ambience. But yoga\\u2019s spiritual juice does not ultimately lie in coffee-table books explaining Hindu philosophy, or the statues of the great Lord Ganesha by the door. As Horton and other yoga bloggers who are wrestling with this case have come to admit \\u2014 and in contrast to the EUSD\\u2019s argument that the children are just stretching \\u2014 deep experience of the discipline does tend to transcend physical culture, though often in ways that are difficult to articulate. On this point, the conservatives running the NCLP might be ready to agree. The specific legal question, however, is whether the Jois curriculum\\u2019s particular mix was \\u2018religious\\u2019. To bolster their case, the NCLP recruited the Harvard-educated academic Candy Gunther Brown, an associate professor of religion at the University of Indiana. Though Brown herself studies evangelicals and healing prayer, her 37-page brief for the NCLP rightly recognises that today\\u2019s postural yoga evolved out of a complex mixture of medieval Hatha yoga, modern Hindu revival movements, British physical culture, and Western metaphysical traditions \\u2014 the same hydra-headed current of occult lore, Theosophy, and self-help philosophies that birthed the \\u2018New Age\\u2019. Brown\\u2019s error lies in unreflexively labelling this decidedly modern m\\u00e9lange \\u2018religion\\u2019 \\u2014 a Latin Christian term inextricably linked to Christianity\\u2019s self-image as the dominant global system of creed, sacrament, and congregation. It is not clear how adequately the term \\u2018religion\\u2019 covers the classic Hindu world, let alone the mutant modern offspring of one limb of that dizzying tradition. What if modern postural yoga is neither religious nor secular, but something in between, or something beyond, something whose evident appeal partly lies in that very liminality? As Stefanie Syman shows in The Subtle Body (2010), her history of yoga in the US, American asana practice has been oscillating for more than a century between ashram and gym, sometimes clothed in exotic veils and other times in low-cut spandex. It is this very oscillation \\u2014 a flux incarnated for many practitioners every time they hit the mat \\u2014 that \\u2018is\\u2019 yoga. Oscillations are tough to read: now you see it, now you don\\u2019t. For her part, Professor Brown indulges in plenty of feverish literalism, describing the sun salute as \\u2018consistent with religious worship\\u2019, and characterising the integration of breath into physical movement as a kind of gateway drug that \\u2018prepares one to unite with the Universal in Samadhi\\u2019. (If only it were so easy!) Other arguments that initially look like Christian conspiracy theory, however, carry more than a few grains of truth. Brown notes that, in much apparently \\u2018secularised\\u2019 yoga, novices first enjoy the physical benefits of the workouts and then begin to receive \\u2018spiritual nuggets\\u2019 from teachers, nuggets that lead deeper into the Hindu worldview. Setting aside the nefarious implications Brown intends, some version of this process occurs all the time. Most yoga teachers are quite comfortable presenting the practice in layers of increasing esoterica. Eventually, at least in my experience, the physical bandhas (contractions) flower into imaginal chakras \\u2014 and head-rushes get reframed as nadi shudders. But what\\u2019s interesting about Brown\\u2019s argument \\u2014 in a sense the key to the Christian evangelists\\u2019 fear of yoga \\u2014 goes beyond religious discourse entirely. Brown claims that the Encinitas yoga curriculum advances Hindu and American metaphysical religion \\u2018whether or not these practices are taught using religious or Hindu language\\u2019. In other words, the spiritual power \\u2014 and threat \\u2014 does not lie within the discourse packaging the moves, but in the moves themselves. Though I suspect it\\u2019s wrong, I love this idea. I love it because it inspires the fantasy that somewhere, somehow, some stressed-out car dealer or soccer mom is going to take a yoga class at a gym (maybe because the instructor is cute) and then, halfway through practice \\u2014 maybe while stretching in pigeon pose, or teetering on elbows in crow \\u2014 the serpent kundalini unwinds her tail, and a fountain of pranic bliss shoots up his or her spine and blooms into a third-eye-opening shudder of wind-chimes and astral rose petals. Brown means something a little more down to earth, of course. She claims that, in contrast to Protestant concerns with the word, Eastern religions express devotion directly through practices that fuse body and mind. The physical practices drawn from those traditions can never be stripped of religion, because the religion \\u2014 others would say \\u2018spirituality\\u2019 \\u2014 already lies in the embodiment. This is a deeply conservative view of religious meaning, with little appreciation for how modern practitioners change these embodied meanings, to say nothing of the interventions of MRI scanning and other tools quantifying the psycho-physiological effects of yoga and meditation. But Brown\\u2019s view does paradoxically, and ironically, accord with leading fantasies that Western seekers hold about their yoga practice, which romantically contend that today\\u2019s postural sequences stretch back continuously through time immemorial, carrying the transmission of the ancient sages. Fortunately, the spiritual efficacy of yoga goes beyond the purview of the courts, whether or not that power is interpreted as summum bonum or a demonic lure. But as far as Brown\\u2019s critique of the Encinitas curriculum itself goes, I have to say that, as a devotee of the First Amendment, I share some of her concerns. The devil is in the detail, and if Brown\\u2019s description is accurate, then the K P Jois Foundation and its school district partners could have done a better job of stripping spiritual language and religious glyphs \\u2014 Chinese t\\u2019ai chi, the yin/yang symbol, or a chart of Patanjali\\u2019s Eight-Fold Path \\u2014 from their materials. That said, I don\\u2019t believe the foundation was trying to smuggle \\u2018Hindu philosophy\\u2019 through the back door, let alone the sun god Surya. They didn\\u2019t think their materials would piss people off, because holistic language and \\u2018Eastern\\u2019 imagery has become the norm as people embrace a wide range of healing modalities, and more and more of us identify as \\u2018spiritual but not religious\\u2019. The real issue is that modern yoga and meditation do create real psychobiological changes, and that those changes are coming to be seen as no longer intrinsically religious or spiritual. As the religious historian Catherine Albanese, argues, one way that the American metaphysical tradition succeeded was by simply dissolving into the culture at large. The mind-over-matter religion of Christian Science, for example, flows directly into corporate self-help seminars. Even the plaintiff in the EUSD case, Jennifer Sedlock, is tainted by this stuff: a Christian motivational speaker, she is also a \\u2018qualified Myers-Briggs consultant\\u2019 \\u2014 a psychological typology system directly based on the ideas of the deeply esoteric (and rather anti-Christian) Carl Jung. Pop metaphysics has become the air we breathe, whether or not we try to synch it up with downward dog. \",\n          \"The face, a nod to her Egyptian mother, is pharaonic, curls freefalling all around it. The muscles packing her body betray countless hours of toil in the pool, on the bench press, on her feet \\u2014 running. Her attire is as blunt in its skimpiness as Jordan, where she lives, is adamant in its conservatism. But while the look screams a fight easily won, her demeanor is tactful, her tenor even-keeled. This is a woman used to negotiating her way through life. I will call her Hadaf, a common enough Arabic name, befitting a woman whose 34 years have been just that: hadaf, meaning singular purpose. At first glance, neither her impressive r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 nor her place in Jordanian society surprise. The milestones are all there: a BA in graphic design from Yarmouk University, up north in Irbid; a stint with a successful advertising agency, followed by a top executive job in a global company; and, just recently, an MBA from the London Business School. In Jordan, among the well-heeled, an education and a career with the tight skirts to match are not unusual. Get to know Hadaf a little better, though, and you uncover a life that encapsulates the hard-going, incessant, yet finally successful struggles of Arab women to transform their unforgiving circumstances into a better set of odds. Hadaf\\u2019s Palestinian father and Egyptian mother met in Egypt in the late 1960s. She was studying interior design, he agricultural engineering. Like thousands of Palestinians looking for a living, and indeed a home, he moved to Kuwait to teach. Hadaf\\u2019s mother soon followed, becoming a teacher herself so as to tiptoe neatly around her husband\\u2019s ego; interior design, they both knew, would have made them better money, but it would have made him feel less of a man. I escaped marriage to that mechanic by parading in a T-shirt in front of his shop. He was the one to break off the engagement When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 and Yasser Arafat took his side, many Palestinians found themselves no longer welcome in the Gulf emirate, and so they moved to Jordan to try to reconstitute a decent life. Hadaf\\u2019s father was among them. Settling on the outskirts of the capital, he started up a spare-parts business, but it failed even before it had built up steam, plunging the entire family into near poverty. There is no equivalent dramatic moment when Hadaf\\u2019s own battles began. No epiphanies that made her want to reach for something different. Her father\\u2019s tumble from middle-class status was not drastic. The neighbourhood was more \\u2018a social than an economic slum\\u2019 \\u2014 very conservative and very comfortable with it. Her mother donned the veil when she hit 40, because that\\u2019s what women in her milieu do upon reaching the gateway to middle age. Her father stopped drinking alcohol but did not pray his way through the days. And there was love around \\u2014 plenty of it. It\\u2019s just that Hadaf walked to the beat of a different drum. \\u2018Inch by inch. This is how I escaped marriage at 16 to a car mechanic; how I shortened the skirt and rolled up the sleeves a tiny bit; how I managed to go to Yarmouk; how I worked as a waitress there, and at the Hard Rock Caf\\u00e9 in Amman during the summers\\u2026 I lobbied my mother, talked my father to death; had him visit the dorms, had him meet the owner of the restaurant up in Irbid, had him pick me up at 2am from the Hard Rock\\u2026 But, you see, I was making a living. It was very difficult for them to argue with that.\\u2019 There were, of course, many fudges, omissions and fibs. \\u2018I did not tell my parents that I moved into my own apartment the second year of college [and] I escaped marriage to that mechanic by parading in a T-shirt in front of his shop. He was the one to break off the engagement. All I had to do then was persuade my father to let me finish high school.\\u2019 When Hadaf started to win the family\\u2019s bread, as it were, the parents went quiet. And they\\u2019ve been quiet ever since. Yet, even now, for their sake, Hadaf says, \\u2018I have two wardrobes at home: one for me, for my life; and one for them, when I go visiting.\\u2019 A movement without movement: women at the metro station in Cairo. Photo by Mark Henly/PanosThe Hadafs of the Arab world outnumber women like me, for whom life has been much gentler. But we don\\u2019t strain to reach out for each other across the divides. I did not have to go in search of her for insight. She lives everywhere around me. Hadaf populates the Middle East. That said, hers is a distinctly upbeat story. Other women are fighting tooth and nail for much smaller breaks. They do win in the end \\u2014 inch by inch \\u2014 but the toll tends to draw age early on a young face, and the demands on grit and courage are almost always insufferably unkind. A 22-year-old Palestinian \\u2013 I\\u2019ll call her Suad \\u2013 works with me on a region-wide community development initiative. She has just set aside her veil in conservative surroundings. She describes her own and her female friends\\u2019 lives in Beirut as an incessant search for opportunity amid a heap of constraints. \\u2018You worry about the consequences, and then you take a step, and then another one after that, and another one after that\\u2026 You make use of every opening.\\u2019 This particular step, her unveiling, has proven to be especially charged. Suad took up the veil, a blend of shapes and colours in her case, at the age of 17, the last in her class to do so. Although most of her school friends were veiled, her parents\\u2019 leftist inclinations helped check the growing calls for Suad to amass herself into the fold. It was her teacher\\u2019s warning that finally tipped the scales. \\u2018She brought me before the entire class and told me that my mother would go to hell if I did not wear it. I succumbed.\\u2019 Suad took off her hijab two months ago, inspired by the rousing theme of nonconformity threading through her English literature courses. She felt she was being true to her identity. Yet reactions to her move in a milieu that actively discourages feminine unorthodoxies are mixed. Suad\\u2019s father is happy to see her let her hair down and so, she thinks, would have been her mother, had she lived to witness this pointed return to visibility. So far, however, the neighbourhood has been worryingly quiet; and the backlash at work, especially among the men, upsetting. In the midst of widespread opprobrium, only one friend has said: \\u2018If that\\u2019s what you want, then do it.\\u2019 Suad shrugs. \\u2018Better this than hypocrisy.\\u2019 On their own, such triumphs as Suad\\u2019s and Hadaf\\u2019s stand as little more than heartening anecdotes on the margins of what is a crushingly discouraging situation for Arab women. One is tempted to ask: only this, after so many years of struggle? But pulled together and read differently, these small victories create a different norm of empowerment \\u2014 one that, paradoxically, draws strength from the very subtlety and everyday nature of the \\u2018dissident\\u2019 acts themselves. Asef Bayat, an authority on Islamism and professor of sociology and Middle Eastern studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, calls this quiet dissent the \\u2018art of presence\\u2019. His term aptly describes the multitudes of women who, through \\u2018the mundane [pursuit] of education, sports, arts, music or work\\u2019, haggle over more space and better terms with deeply conservative authoritarian regimes and patriarchal societies. If their methods stand in stark contrast to the public activism typically exercised in the West, it is with good reason: they are much more effective in extricating concessions from systems that are lethally unresponsive to organised action. The path of resistance is thus a \\u2018non-movement\\u2019 by defenseless constituencies, massaging the possible in pervasively hostile environments. As Islamists reap the rewards of last year\\u2019s Arab uprisings, the fear is they will overturn what little rights have accrued for women Even during a supposedly more liberal Arab moment, decades back, women walked this same path. For the novelist Hanan al-Shaykh, Hadaf\\u2019s journey recalls episodes from her own youth in Lebanon: \\u2018That\\u2019s how we did it back in the 1950s and \\u201960s. Piecemeal. Small steps hiding big dreams. If a girl from Nabatieh [in the south] had her eyes on Beirut, she would tell her family she just wanted to go to Sidon [a bigger town than her own]. If she wanted to get a university education, she would settle for a teaching diploma or nursing.\\u2019 While some women adopt the hijab others take it off in a \\u2018pointed return to visibility\\u2019 . Photo by Mark Henley/PanosThe incrementalism of Hanan al-Shaykh\\u2019s days would shadow breakthroughs not retreats. \\u2018Layla Ba\\u2019albaki\\u2019s monumental novel Ana Ahya (I Live), published in 1958, tore through so many taboos,\\u2019 she tells me. \\u2018You could see the modern Arab woman take shape. There were pressures, but we had just started. Life was like a Chinese cupboard: one drawer for politics, one for culture, one for religion\\u2026 You could be angry at the West and yet long for conversations with it.\\u2019 In the event, Hanan al-Shaykh has managed this tricky path with expert footing, for in spite of her daring writings she is still well received in many Arab countries, including those where her novels are banned. When I look back on a century of Arab women\\u2019s struggles myself, and regardless of how many stages the experts delineate for us through a history battered by colonialism and harangued by our own aggrieved search for cultural authenticity, my sense is that our activism has always been about that art of presence. This is not to suggest that this region has been free of concerted public advocacy for gender rights. But that too, inevitably, has had to be a rather genteel prodding of the state, carefully balancing its very masculine sensibilities with emphatic demands for better legal protections. It is not surprising that, in these potentially revolutionary times, the prospects for Arab women seem grim. We\\u2019ve been here before. When men mobilised against colonial powers in the first half of the 20th century, women moved along with them, hoping that some of the resulting freedoms would include them. They didn\\u2019t. But then, as dictatorships quickly took root everywhere, liberation would end up offering little to the men themselves. The fear now, as Islamists appear to be reaping the rewards of last year\\u2019s Arab uprisings, is that history will repeat itself. Even worse, that Islamism will connive to overturn what little rights have accrued for women. Yet many commentators obsessing about our dire predicament seem to be under the impression that as the winds shift radically for systems at large, so they must for the female gender. Frantically, they look for ruptures between the present and the future, when \\u2014 should the pessimists win \\u2014 tomorrow, for us, will be very much like the better part of today: a continuum, a plodding, patient, opportunistic negotiation for rights in a region where patriarchal prerogative is stubbornly entrenched in custom and religion, and, of course, in law. For what does it mean, in the 21st century, that Jordanian and Lebanese women still cannot give their nationality to their children? Or that Article 308 in Jordan\\u2019s penal code saves a rapist from prosecution if he agrees to marry his victim and the marriage lasts five years? What does it mean that Article 277 in Egypt\\u2019s penal code stipulates that a man is guilty of adultery only if he commits the act at his marital home, whereas a woman is guilty regardless of where the act takes place? Or that the personal status code of the Lebanese Maronites declares a girl of 14 eligible for marriage with her guardian\\u2019s consent, 15 without? \\u2018You make use of every opening\\u2019: young women in Cairo. Photo by Mark Henley/PanosScores of women practically everywhere in the Middle East are the easy victims of honour crimes for which sentences remain the most lenient in the legal books. What does that mean? Let me add here the veil, as a finale, and ask what it means when the hijab has become every other female\\u2019s constant companion? With political Islam beating at the door, it is tempting to anticipate the dawn of another 1979 \\u2014 the year that turned Iran upside down \\u2014 with its ushering in of \\u2018subversive\\u2019 Shia Islamism and its wardrobe of visual props: the veil, the turban, the beard, the open hand beating against a heaving chest. But it is a bizarre temptation, with such different shades of Islamism already in full sight, from the austere Wahhabism of Saudi Arabia to the obnoxious militarist fundamentalism of Sudan, and to the Brotherhood of Hamas in Gaza. Countries such as Jordan and Egypt might have appeared to stand firm against such headwinds. But, in truth, the wins there have been few, while the concessions to stricter interpretations of Sharia have been many, rendering family law a perversion of the civic rights embedded elsewhere in their constitutions. Only Tunisia resisted fundamentalist encroachments, remaining as conspicuously secular as it was authoritarian under both Habib Bourguiba and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Which explains why there is so much post-revolutionary angst that women\\u2019s rights in Tunisia will be subject to drastic reversals. So there is no sense, really, in trying to fashion out of a very complicated narrative a simpler, more straightforward story. Even that hijab \\u2014 often flagged up, since its spirited rush through the late 1970s, as the clearest proof of our break with a presumably progressive past \\u2014 can\\u2019t quite bend to stereotype, camouflaging a battle for agency that has been as hard to fight without it as it has been with it. In this century-long grind, it would have to be the hijab, wouldn\\u2019t it, that offers up a chronicle wrapped head to toe in irony. Of course this powerful symbol would galvanise warring camps. Once shedding it was cited \\u2014 tellingly enough, by both sides \\u2014 as evidence that (Western) modernity was winning the argument in the (conquered) East, it was bound to be taken up again, as armour, by women in harassed societies, questing for their inner voice by way of a rebuttal. In veiling herself, a woman seeks reprieve as well as freedom of movement \\u2014 akin to closing the windows in order to keep the door open As a matter of fact, for a sea of veiled Arab Muslim women, the veil has never been a choice \\u2014 pure and simple. Equally, it has always been the happy route of those who believe they are fulfilling God\\u2019s wish \\u2014 no more, no less. But when scholars went in search of explanations, they found women at the forefront of the discontent that has fuelled the veil\\u2019s ready adoption as a centerpiece of identity politics. If the relatively better educated \\u2014 and, yes, more affluent \\u2014 types were first to unveil in the early years of independence, soon followed by others further down the economic rung, so the daughters of the rising middle classes would be first to put it back on a few decades later, sending it up the same rung. That Islamists, who had long been rallying to spread this star marker of their influence, grabbed a hold of the trend and ran with it was just smart strategy and brilliant timing. They plowed fertile minds and made use of every advantage in a propitious regional climate: the collapse of Gamal Abdel Nasser and his charade of secularism and Arabism in Egypt; the Gulf money that sponsored the dimmest visions of Islam almost everywhere in the East; the ripening fight against leftist currents in the region, in which religion would be the sharpest of weapons. All this passed with little comment under the watchful eyes \\u2014 and often active encouragement \\u2014 of our so-called Western friends. There are lessons to be learned from Columbia University professor Lila Abu-Lughod\\u2019s reminder that \\u2018some of the most conservative movements that focus on women in these parts of the world have resulted from interactions with the West\\u2019. Perhaps the most consequential of these lessons is that the insistence on context is not scapegoatism. It seems embarrassingly elementary, but easily the most unfortunate failure of thought in the debate on Arab women\\u2019s subjugation has been the race between those who conveniently locate the problem strictly within the Arab-Muslim self, and those who furiously look everywhere else for culprits. The problem, of course, is a miserable brew of both. Nor is the damage limited to the quality of the debate. For by ignoring the impact of policy on the direction of culture and politics, we risk the most wrongheaded of remedies. With plights as fraught with pain as that of Arab women, however, context is a tricky thing. It often trespasses on comforting stereotypes and requires studied deliberation when the wounded heart thirsts for indictments of the sweeping kind. If you listen to the arguments of the hijab\\u2019s early champions, for example, you find yourself weaving a paradox of defiance in retreat, of empowerment through conformity. The more women went about their business freely in public, the more the indignities seemed to pile up in the hustle and bustle of life in, say, 1970s Cairo. On buses, in the workplace, in the neighbourhood, at university, there boomed the loud discomforts of a society that had never quite accepted women as full partners in the public arena. Hence the merciless harassments that have turned a supposed act of emancipation into a sellout to Western corruptions. Rebellion in the guise of the surrender: the hijab is swathed in ironies. Photo by Mark Henley/PanosThe motivations that crowned the veil on many a woman\\u2019s head are various: there\\u2019s the need for a shield, for an expression of faith in one\\u2019s embattled heritage, or simply the compulsion to follow the example of others \\u2014 easier to fade into the pervading scene, and to belong. In veiling herself, a woman might at once seek reprieve as well as retain some form of freedom of movement in stubbornly inhospitable climates. By consciously taking her visage out of contention, she might be allowed to carve a respectable space for herself \\u2014 akin to closing the windows in order to keep the door open. More than 30 years have passed since the veil made its comeback, but talk to women today and the stories you hear have the same complex weave. As Dina El Sherif, an Egyptian in her mid-30s, and a professional in the field of social entrepreneurship, put it to me in a moment of exasperation: \\u2018We [women] live in a constant state of struggle \\u2014 culturally, socially, economically, politically. It\\u2019s\\u2026 exhausting.\\u2019 She happened to opt out of the hijab. Others didn\\u2019t. Surrender in the guise of rebellion? That\\u2019s always been easy to argue about the veil. But so, it needs to be said, is rebellion in the guise of surrender. Ultimately, there is something inescapably unsatisfying about the nuance here \\u2014 much like that larger one which pervades the larger issue of the repression of Arab women. For even the most sensitive reading of the veil and its many meanings cannot avoid the rueful question that Samar Dudin, a 49-year old Jordanian activist and community organiser, voiced towards the end of one of our many conversations: Tell me, will you: what kind of a free choice is it, when you\\u2019re making it out of fear, or need ofsutra(protection), or intolerable peer pressure, or just, for the love of God, to be left alone? How do you actually practice free choice in the absence of even a semblance of freedom? I mean, where does this kind of contamination in a supposed act of free will belong in this debate?More than exposing the serious tensions between obligations and rights under Islamism, her question brings into sharp relief the more fundamental matter of citizenship and its requirements, specifically those that postcolonial regimes wiped clean from the lexicon of Arab politics. Opinion-makers \\u2014 male and female, Eastern and Western \\u2014 who attempt to disentangle the case for Arab women from the wider disquiet that triggered the uprisings do it a most grave injustice. The complaint against Islam and/or patriarchy, however appealing, is incomplete. Implicated though they might be, the more effective attack is against despotism and its local and foreign patrons who have cynically played and reinforced both, leaving targets, such as women, vulnerable to all manner of assaults. How optimistic dare we be in our predictions about a region that is extremely susceptible to political manipulations? It is telling that the very first tide of Arab female activism accompanied the battle against Empire, while this current one of Islamic feminism accompanies the fight against domestic tyranny. I say Islamic feminism because, predictably, as societies and polities have become more decidedly Islamic, so have, in the main, the public endeavors by and on behalf of women. That, after all, has been the path of gender rights in the Arab world from the outset: a pragmatic, incremental approach that has almost always moved with wider trends. We have been marching towards a crossroads for a while now. The Arab revolts had the unique honour of announcing it. But the forces at play have long been in the making. We are, in fact, in the midst of heated post-Islamist arguments over a religion that has been brought down to arbitrate even the minutiae of everyday existence; between those who insist that Islam is a strict regime of unalterable duties and rituals meant to control the very rhythm of life, and those who counter that it is but a body of evolving ethics designed to guide but never govern. It is in such arguments that the future of the Arab world lies \\u2014 and, by extension, our own future as Arab Muslim women. If successful, the drive for a more participatory and expansive politics will necessarily embolden demands for human and civic rights, in which case women\\u2019s struggle will become more audacious and insistent. If it fails, then autarchy will regain momentum, and we\\u2019ll just keep plodding on. Barely a few pages into this new era in Arab history, you could sketch it every which way you like. For every female friend who sees a magnificent opportunity I have one doubting the odds, while the news keeps churning out headlines about us that lift the spirit only to sink them again. For Dina, the 30-something from Cairo who chose not to wear the veil and who has always been as comfortable with her faith as she is with her \\u2018liberal\\u2019 self, one recent experience has become a measure of how life has already begun to change. Previously, Cairo\\u2019s notorious pre-revolutionary streets had subjected her to the usual mixture of disdain and cold-shouldering. But right after the uprising, she started to experience more threatening taunts, urging her to cover up. She flinched at first, scurrying ahead to avoid contact \\u2014 a rather strange reaction for the self-described offspring of \\u2018a family of very strong women\\u2019. But these slurs had much sharper edges than the insults of old. And then, suddenly, she decided to do her own one-woman revolt. She started to shout back. \",\n          \"Pop-up philosophy. Stop, sit down and just think. That\\u2019s what I wrote on a whiteboard \\u2013 then I took it outside and propped it next to a small folding chair near the entrance to my office at City, University of London. For a week, I had been travelling around London with two folding deckchairs and a whiteboard. My quarry was stupidity-intensive spots. I had set up outside the London Stock Exchange, a large bank that had been bailed out by the taxpayer, the Houses of Parliament, Oxford Street, St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral and the BBC. Now it was time to reflect on the stupidities closest to home. So I set up my deckchairs outside my own university. Students and faculty came and went, saw the deckchairs, looked at me, read my sign. Some seemed surprised. Others took a photo with their smartphones. Many laughed. A few sat down and joined me in a few minutes of quiet contemplation. Universities are supposed to be seats of learning and engines of the knowledge economy. But a decade spent studying stupidity-intensive organisations had taught me that, all too often, universities are hothouses for organised idiocy. I myself am a professor. When I ask my colleagues from different universities to describe their own institutions, one of the most frequent words they use is \\u2018stupid\\u2019. They share stories of British universities that value a journal article of a few pages more than a landmark monograph of hundreds of pages. I heard about a large public university that spent tens of millions of dollars to develop a private university that attracted only a handful of students. My editor chimed in with the story of an Ivy League university in the US that spent $25 million to launch an online \\u2018knowledge network\\u2019 called Fathom that closed after three years. My favourite was the tale of the world-famous expert in intelligence who became the president of a US university, and then quickly spent more than $1 million on administrative changes. During his short tenure, he alienated faculty by instituting pet projects and insisting that they wear brown clothes around campus on Fridays. The more I looked, the more I discovered that universities habitually invested time, energy and resources into all manner of pointless initiatives. These created dense thickets of administration that often made even the simplest tasks inefficient in the extreme. Universities today routinely run rebranding campaigns to distinguish themselves, but that end up making them more indistinguishable from their peers. Take a close look at a university website and you\\u2019ll find the same PR boilerplate about having cutting-edge research, world-class teaching and real-world relevance. You\\u2019ll also see photos of the same three students lounging around on a lawn. One woman, one person of colour, one white guy. More adventurous seats of higher learning add two men in the background playing frisbee. Colleges on opposite sides of the world have almost identical branding campaigns. The University at Buffalo used a picture of college buildings overlaid with the words \\u2018Here is how\\u2019; 9,000 miles away, the University of Sydney used a similar image of old buildings, again with the tag line \\u2018Here\\u2019. In many universities, the simple fact that the commercial sector has adopted a practice is enough reason for leaders to give it a try. This keeps consultants peddling management fads in business, but it usually results in a dense sediment of procedures and regulations that few understand and none really believe to be effective. Universities support cultures that encourage faculty to work late into the night researching and writing scholarly papers that will be read by a small handful of other hyper-specialised experts. What they rarely support is time to think. Andr\\u00e9 Spicer takes time out to think. Photo by Barbara KukovecI hoped that my deckchairs might give professors and students an opportunity, even if for a moment, to do nothing but think. A handful of colleagues joined me, quietly sitting. \\u2018It\\u2019s nice to be able to think for once,\\u2019 one said. \\u2018I spent most of the day writing reviews of pointless research papers,\\u2019 another noted. \\u2018That\\u2019s pretty mindless,\\u2019 he added. Another told me: \\u2018It\\u2019s like being at my summer-house back in Finland. That\\u2019s when I do my thinking.\\u2019 Today, we live in a culture of thoughtlessness. The American Time Use Survey found that although 95 per cent of respondents said that they did at least one leisure activity during the previous 24 hours, 84 per cent had spent no time at all relaxing or thinking. A study by researchers at Harvard University found that when we engaged in thought that was not directly related to present activity (so-called mind-wandering), we tended to be less happy. A recent study by psychologists at the University of Virginia asked subjects to simply sit in a room and \\u2018just think\\u2019 for 6 to 15 minutes. In the room was a button allowing subjects to electrocute themselves if they wanted. The researchers found that the majority of subjects would rather electrocute themselves than just sit quietly and think. One person electrocuted himself 190 times during this short period. The vast army of electronic devices surrounding us has proven an able ally to our fear of thinking. Only a decade or two ago, everyday life held many small parcels of time in which we would be marooned with our thoughts: queuing, sitting on public transport, idling in a traffic jam, or even just waiting for a friend. Today, the first thing people do when faced with a moment of downtime is to reach for their smartphone. A study by the market research agency Harris Interactive in 2013 found that we use our smartphones when walking down the street, watching films, or while in places of religious worship; 12 per cent admitted to using their phone while taking a shower; 9 per cent had checked their smartphone during sex. Once interrupted, it takes employees on average 25 minutes to get back to their original task Unending stimulation hampers the capacity for thought. One study suggested that being constantly distracted by information momentarily reduces a person\\u2019s IQ by 10 points, double the intelligence-impairing effect of smoking marijuana. Mixing electronic devices with activities such as working, playing with children or having sex means that we are dividing attention between multiple tasks. Although some of us think that we are great at multitasking, the reality is that we are not. Neuroscientists have found that no one, properly speaking, multitasks. People just ricochet between different tasks, doing each less than well, as Adam Gazzaley and Larry D Rosen argue in The Distracted Mind (2016). One experimental study by Alessandro Acquisti and Eyal Peer at Carnegie Mellon University found that when students taking a test are interrupted, their performance dips by 20 per cent. Knowledge-intensive organisations already hum with distractions. Many meetings, phone calls, messages and queries from colleagues are meaningless requests that impede thought. Open-plan offices usually make matters worse by inviting all manner of interruptions, from the overly talkative colleague to the intrusive manager. This prompts employees to switch tasks frequently. According to a study by Gloria Mark at the University of California, Irvine, employees in an office switch task on average every 11 minutes or so. Once they have been interrupted, it takes employees on average 25 minutes to get back to their original task. The figures are frightening. In their study The Progress Principle (2011), Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer at Harvard Business School found that nothing contributed more to a sense of a good day\\u2019s work as the time to focus and make progress on an important task. With distraction always at our fingertips, it seems that we are in desperate need of a little more time to think. I wondered what a space where people could just think might look like. The image of Ludwig Wittgenstein sitting in a deckchair in his sparely decorated rooms in Cambridge came to mind. That\\u2019s how my experiment in pop-up philosophy began. I wanted to offer people the opportunity to stop, sit down and think \\u2013 even if it was just for five minutes. There is a small public square right outside the London Stock Exchange, directly opposite the Bank of England. At midday on a cloudy early autumn day, I sat down in one of the white deckchairs. I was nervous. Would the police come and charge me with disturbing the public peace? Within five minutes, I had my first recruit. A middle-aged Australian woman who wanted to talk about terrorism. Soon, an English woman joined us and began to talk about her daughter studying philosophy at university. \\u2018She\\u2019s a deep thinker,\\u2019 the woman said. After five minutes, they were gone. The people surrounding me, mainly workers from nearby financial firms, were on their lunch break. They were scoffing packets of crisps and stabbing at their smartphones. Then, the odd passing tourist would stop, laugh and take a photo that would probably be uploaded to Facebook later that day. Feeling disheartened with the modest public debut of pop-up philosophy, I returned to my own thoughts, or tried to. What should I think about, I asked myself. The city? Office workers\\u2019 lunch-hour rituals? Financial capitalism? I wondered whether, if I had access to a button that could give me an enlivening electrical jolt, I would push it now? Slowly I drifted into a kind of pleasant nothingness, watching the clouds scud above the buildings. \\u2018Is this thinking?\\u2019 I wondered. When 2pm struck, I stood up, folded my chair, and headed for the tube station. Sunbathing in the rain: it seemed to characterise some of the years I had spent studying philosophical texts I held my two deckchairs on a noisy underground train, and contemplated what I had learned from my first experience with pop-up philosophy. I certainly felt much calmer. Still, I also felt disappointment that only tourists had joined in with my experiment. Would someone not on vacation allow herself the luxury of sitting down and thinking for a few moments? The question bothered me, in part because I couldn\\u2019t focus my own mind and just think for a few hours. One consideration made me suspect pop-up philosophy had not been an entire failure: once I broke through the desire to focus on something (whether it was the nature of multinational capitalism, or the clock across the square), simple mind-wandering seemed to be an altogether pleasant experience. Eager to continue pop-up philosophy, I ventured back a few days later, to St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral \\u2013 the most important church in London. My friend Barbara accompanied me. We unfolded the deckchairs, propped up the sign reading \\u2018Stop, sit down and just think\\u2019, and I lowered myself into one of the chairs. Barbara stood at a distance to observe. Within a few minutes, it was raining. A young girl ran up and asked: \\u2018Why are you sunbathing in the rain?\\u2019 I had no good answer. Her father dragged her away, but her question remained. Sunbathing in the rain. It seemed to characterise some of the years I had spent studying philosophical texts. Over the next few weeks, I travelled around London with my pop-up philosophy experiment. I set it up on Oxford Street, one of the busiest high streets in Europe \\u2013 and one of the most polluted. Most shoppers ignored me. The few who engaged asked if I was promoting a new luxury brand. The only ones who seemed interested were the religious proselytisers. Perhaps they saw me as competition. Outside the headquarters of the BBC, I encountered only a bored security guard. He already had more than enough time to think during his shift. I took the experiment to Speakers\\u2019 Corner, a spot in Hyde Park where people gather to debate any imaginable topic. Here, pop-up philosophy attracted passers-by who found a moment of silence from the cacophonous marketplace of ideas a welcome respite. A heckler looking for prey approached me. \\u2018Very clever,\\u2019 he said, with evident disapproval. He explained how the pop-up philosophy sign contained a devilish hidden message. I didn\\u2019t understand. I thought pop-up philosophy might find its stride at the heart of political power \\u2013 Westminster. I unfolded the chairs on Parliament Square, and fantasised about passing politicians taking a few moments out of their day to reflect on what they were doing. Perhaps pop-up philosophy would instigate a new era of public reason, starting right here. Instead, a group of German teenage girls eager to take selfies convened around my chairs. An American family followed. The dad performed handstands behind my deckchair while mom adopted the \\u2018Thinker\\u2019 pose in one chair and their children munched on fistfuls of candy. The politicians and civil servants passing by were too engrossed in their phones to notice pop-up philosophy. Interestingly, the London headquarters of a bank that had been bailed out by the government during the financial crisis was the site of pop-up philosophy\\u2019s greatest success. Within minutes of unfolding the chairs, a security guard was concerned to make sure I was off the bank\\u2019s property. I settled this by moving a few inches. Then two more security staff immediately approached, worried about the reputational risk that pop-up philosophy might pose to the bank. Hot on their heels was a homeless woman who asked me what I was doing. \\u2018Thinking,\\u2019 I told her. She replied: \\u2018I don\\u2019t have time for that.\\u2019 A steady stream of bank workers saw my sign and smiled. Many took photos, presumably to be posted to social media. Some sat down for a few minutes, quietly thought, then went on their way. A few others wanted to talk \\u2013 including an anthropologist-turned-hedge-funder who told me she longed for some time to use her mind during the day. An analytic-philosopher-turned-tech-entrepreneur sat and spoke of his concern for how philosophy engaged the public. The bailed-out-bank site brought forward both fear of pop-up philosophy and the most thoughtful responses, suggesting some deep contradictory energies are swirling around these financial institutions. Pop-up philosophy was more of an occasion for selfie-snapping than self-reflection I returned to my university and once again set up pop-up philosophy. Here, I planned to think about what the experiment had taught me. I\\u2019m not a neuroscientist, so I lacked EEG read-outs or fMRI scans to understand how the brain activity of the participants in my experiment had changed. All I had were notes of my observations. Pop-up philosophy had shown that thinking in public could be a security risk. For many people, pop-up philosophy was more of an occasion for selfie-snapping than self-reflection. Despite the invitation to sit down and just think, people could not resist digital distraction. But dozens of people had quietly sat, thought, and then moved on. A brave few spoke with me. Most shared a concern that philosophy, and thinking more generally, had grown into something that happens only within the safe confines of universities. These thoughtful pedestrians worried that thinking in everyday public life was in short supply. Sitting outside my own university, I wondered how much real thinking goes on within. My pop-up philosophy experiment invited people to sit and think. I am not sure how philosophical the few minutes of sitting on a deckchair made people. It did not convince me that a good dose of public philosophy will make public life more thoughtful. Certainly, however, in the dozens of hours I spent with pop-up philosophy, sitting on a deckchair around London, I did more thinking than I had in years while in my university office. Perhaps the most important thing the experiment taught me was something that Aristotle wrote about 2,500 years ago \\u2013 contemplation is a great human virtue that can lead us to happiness. Buoyed by these reflections, I picked up my deckchairs one last time and returned to Parliament Square. A stern security guard instructed me that I was not allowed to sit on the Square. Instead I was forced to erect pop-up philosophy and its sign on the footpath. I was next to the spot where Brian Haw had camped out for nearly 10 years in protest against the Iraq war. While I kicked back and started to think about how this was a much nicer way to spend the morning than slaving over some administrative task in the office, I heard a voice coming from a white delivery van. \\u2018So what is truth?\\u2019 the driver yelled. \\u2018That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to figure out,\\u2019 I replied before the lights changed and he drove away. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1655,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Larry Temkin\",\n          \"Helen De Cruz\",\n          \"David Waltner-Toews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2235,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://aeon.co//essays/are-you-flexible-enough-to-worship-the-sun\",\n          \"https://aeon.co//essays/inch-by-inch-what-next-for-the-women-of-the-arab-spring\",\n          \"https://aeon.co//essays/do-we-all-need-a-little-time-simply-to-sit-and-think\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"thumbnail_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2235,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://images.aeonmedia.co/images/bdf0839b-6104-4992-b35e-b631d4a1e964/Yoga-children.jpg?width=3840&quality=75&format=auto\",\n          \"https://images.aeonmedia.co/images/0605ed4c-3790-4e23-9b5f-6791750b813f/Three-Egyptian-women1.jpg?width=3840&quality=75&format=auto\",\n          \"https://images.aeonmedia.co/images/485c9a0a-44f3-4dfa-9860-324a2e5f9e72/essay-final-nn11492696.jpg?width=3840&quality=75&format=auto\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Let's get Maximum Word Count of 'description' Column -

High-intensity or \\u2018factory\\u2019 farming raises the biggest questions because of its sheer scale, and because routine practices there, once we look closely, often appear shocking. Vast numbers of animals spend much or all of their short lives in confined, sunless spaces, their experience a combination of stress, monotony and pain. Babs. Donkey, aged 24 Image \\u00a9Isa LeshkoIs this wrong, and what kind of wrongness is it? These questions are often approached within a utilitarian framework, which holds that the reduction of suffering and promotion of experienced wellbeing comprise our basic goals in moral affairs. That view is readily applied to our treatment of animals, as seen especially in the work of the Australian philosopher Peter Singer. A rival tradition in moral philosophy derives from the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, who held that our goal should not be getting better things to happen by any available means \\u2013 as endorsed in utilitarianism \\u2013 but acting in ways that respect the preferences and projects of others. A person should try to act, in any situation, in a way that would make sense if everyone followed the same rule that they do. This emphasis on relationships gives rise to a somewhat different view of what we should do in many contexts, and there\\u2019s also a difference in what this philosophical theory attempts to achieve. Kant, and those following him, try to show that if we think hard about what is involved in making ordinary decisions in a rational way, we will realise that we are bound to respect the interests of others, as well as our own. Utilitarian philosophers have occasionally attempted something analogous, but not usually. Many utilitarians have gotten used to the idea that, if someone just isn\\u2019t moved by the suffering of others, not much can be said to turn them round. Christine Korsgaard, professor of philosophy at Harvard, is a leading contemporary figure in the Kantian approach to moral philosophy. She thinks the Kantian view of morality is mostly right \\u2013 right in outline, though best augmented with ideas from the earlier Greek philosopher Aristotle. In her book Fellow Creatures (2018), Korsgaard also extends the reach of Kant\\u2019s approach. Kant himself did not care much about nonhuman animals and our treatment of them. He was concerned with people, with how people should treat each other. He thought that, insofar as we should care about animal welfare, this is because of the effects that cruel behaviours here have on us, on our characters. Korsgaard argues that, once Kant\\u2019s ideas have been reworked, we find that they apply to our treatment of animals more directly, in ways Kant did not see, and should lead us to change our behaviour in very significant ways. This case is made not by way of a plea, an exhortation to \\u2018expand the circle\\u2019 of concern, a move we might make if we choose. The argument is supposed to have more force than that \\u2013 it is supposed, roughly speaking, to compel. In a review of Korsgaard\\u2019s book, the US philosopher Thomas Nagel says that, if her view prevailed, \\u2018it would be one of the largest moral transformations in the history of humanity\\u2019. Ash. Domestic white turkey, aged 8 Image \\u00a9Isa LeshkoKorsgaard\\u2019s book is also much less technical and difficult than most work in this area. It has almost none of the numbing convolution of much writing in Kantian ethics. The book is aimed at an audience like this one, an Aeon audience, not just academic insiders. It is a clear statement by someone who has spent much of her life working on these themes, continually trying to strip away inessential details that might prevent us getting to the heart of the matter. I think that, once we work through it, we see that the main argument she offers does not work. I want to show this, and then turn again to those questions about animals. If Korsgaard\\u2019s Kant can\\u2019t lead us, are we left back where we were before? Suppose one suspects that animals deserve better treatment, and should not be kept on those factory farms \\u2013 or, in the more accurate term often used within the industry, in \\u2018confined feeding operations\\u2019. How can we decide if this is right? One way is to find something in their lives \\u2013 suffering, stress \\u2013 that we can recognise as just bad, and try to reduce it. Some goings-on in the world have a bright glow of goodness, it seems, while others are infused with a kind of metaphysical gloom. Korsgaard takes what looks like a harder road. Value does not exist as a sort of aura surrounding things in the world itself; value comes from valuing. It comes from the fact that people, and perhaps agents other than people, seek some things and avoid others. Without valuers, there is no value. If we start here, we face the fact that valuing can be based on all kinds of bias, caprice and distortion. To be valued (by someone or something) is surely not enough to be worthy of it. Korsgaard wants to resolve this by looking more closely at how we act and make decisions in everyday cases \\u2013 not when we are trying to be especially kind to others, but generally. A full understanding of some of our own ordinary choices will push us, she thinks, to take seriously others\\u2019 interests and goals. The Kantian idea is that a kind of fulcrum is provided by your own actions, by your sense of yourself as a decision-maker who acts for reasons. This sense of your own reasonableness can lead you to treat others in a way that respects their own preferences \\u2013 not to go along with everything they might want, but to have a basic respect for what they are trying to do. For Kant, the \\u2018others\\u2019 whose goals we come to respect are other people. For Korsgaard, they include animals as well. The argument starts simply. When we do ordinary things \\u2013 decide what to do with our weekend, for example \\u2013 we usually take ourselves to have reasons for doing what we\\u2019re doing. Suppose you made a choice while knowing that there is no reason you could offer for it. Then you are, in a way, incoherent, not a genuine agent. You might resist at this early step, and say: \\u2018I just do what I want at that moment! I don\\u2019t care about the deeper coherence of my actions.\\u2019 How bad is that? Maybe not that bad \\u2013 we should not overstate the case. But there is a point here. When we don\\u2019t think that reasons can be given for what we\\u2019re doing, something important is lacking in our choices. Kant\\u2019s aim was to justify a respect for other people. Animals don\\u2019t count So you think your choices have reasons behind them and, if these reasons are good ones, then you think that others, in principle, could see this, too. You recognise in yourself, and think that others should recognise in you, a choice aimed at something worth seeking, and a choice by someone who can make that call. This means that what you are after is \\u2018good\\u2019 not just in a sense confined to you, but visible to everyone. Once the goodness of your choice is visible to everyone, it is a kind of absolute goodness \\u2013 a goodness that anyone could recognise. Does this view ignore the obvious fact that different people want different things? What seems good to you need not seem good to me. The idea is not that you think that everyone should want the same things as you, or the idea that your valuing something should always make others override their own interests. But, according to Korsgaard, your valuing something does give you, and what you value, a status that others should take into account. The fact that you value something in this way makes it part of what she calls \\u2018a shared or common good\\u2019. So far, all this is about how things look to you, as you make ordinary choices. But you can see that other people are like this, too. In others, we can see the same kind of pursuit of goals. Just as the reasonableness of your choices takes your goals into the realm of a shared good, the same applies to what they choose. A respect for our own rationality leads us to see other people, also, as making choices that we should respect. Violet. Potbellied pig, aged 12 Image \\u00a9Isa LeshkoKant\\u2019s aim was to justify a respect for other people. Animals don\\u2019t count. They don\\u2019t make choices in the way we do, and can never become part of a community where these principles of reciprocal respect apply. Korsgaard, however, thinks this understates the power of the Kantian approach. Though other animals can\\u2019t make choices in our reflective way, we can see that they do pursue what is good for them: we humans \\u2018are not the only beings for whom things can be good or bad\\u2019. In this case, too, the goodness they seek becomes more than mere goodness-for-them. It is also an absolute good, part of a universally shared good. And we are committed (already, from our own case) to respecting that sort of quest. We should then change or abandon a great many ways we treat animals, rejecting not just the excesses of high-intensity farming, but humane farming where death might be painless, and animal experimentation in research even when the work might, because of its benefits, pass a utilitarian test. Some of what might be questioned here is Korsgaard\\u2019s extension of the Kantian argument to animals \\u2013 the idea that their very different choices still aim at something we should see as a shared or absolute good. But I think the more basic problem is found at a much earlier stage in the argument, in the attempt to get our own choices to play that fulcrum-like role. Let\\u2019s return to those ordinary choices that set the story into motion, and work through things again. I, after some thought, decide I want to do X. I think I have good reason. I think that others will see that it makes sense for me to do X. They will see that, if they were in my shoes, they would want to do something similar \\u2013 more accurately, not if they were in my shoes, as it shouldn\\u2019t matter which particular person is involved, but in shoes like mine. This makes my choice defensible. In a way, the goodness of what I am after, along with the reasonableness of what I am up to, is visible to everyone. So far, though, there is no reason why I should expect them, in very different shoes, to put any value of their own on what I am doing. They will endorse it, I think, for anyone in shoes like mine, but there\\u2019s no reason yet for them to endorse it beyond that. You can have a respect for my good sense without being motivated to help me. You might choose to help me, if you are OK with what I am doing or just a benevolent sort of person. But you might not, and your refusal can be both reasonable and compatible with my reasonableness. Korsgaard says at one point, when talking about these ordinary choices, that we not only think that we have good reason to pursue the projects we do, but also \\u2018expect others not to interfere with that pursuit without some important reason for doing so, and even to help us pursue them should the need arise.\\u2019 In reply: I don\\u2019t expect this. I hope for it, am pleased when it happens, and am also glad to live in a society where interference is discouraged. But I don\\u2019t think that, just because another person will see that what I am doing makes sense for someone in a situation like mine, they will think they have reason to help me. Their situation, again, is different. Some trouble comes from the word \\u2018absolute\\u2019, which Korsgaard uses when talking about the important kind of goodness. She does not mean absolute in a lofty sense. Something is absolutely good when it can be recognised as good by everyone. But there are two ways something can be recognised as good by everyone. It might be recognised, by everyone, as good for anyone who is in shoes like mine. That does not mean it is recognised as good in a further sense where it becomes part of a shared good, a good that everyone has reason to pursue. It\\u2019s an attempt to leverage the inevitable sociability of human life into respect for the goals of others Korsgaard says that, given how we make choices and defend them, \\u2018we think that our achieving our ends is good from the point of view of others and not merely good-for-us.\\u2019 It is, indeed, often visible from their point of view as good for someone in a situation of a particular kind, but so far that\\u2019s all. There is a context-relativity here, a relativity to circumstances, that keeps recurring and does not go away. Handsome One. Thoroughbred horse, aged 33 Image \\u00a9Isa LeshkoThis is not working so far. Perhaps there are other ways to make the case. Korsgaard here is treading one route through a blizzard (perhaps a hailstorm) of argument in Kant\\u2019s own writings, and she is downplaying a lot of grand but less plausible moves he makes. (Even I, very far indeed from this project, sometimes think I can glimpse, through the blizzard or hail, the castle that keeps Kantians going.) Korsgaard is reorganising and refining the ideas that seem most likely to get us somewhere. So let\\u2019s try various options. Maybe a wrong turn was taken with the idea that when you think your projects are reasonable, you treat your goals as part of a shared good. Might it be enough that you think you have good reason to value something, and you recognise that others do, too? Then other people might have reason to respect your valuing, and you might have reason to value theirs, even though what each person values is quite different. However, even if others have reason to respect your good sense, given your situation, if they don\\u2019t see what you value as part of a shared good, then they have no reason to help you. The idea that the goals a person reasonably pursues become part of a shared good really does matter here, and we are not getting to it. Another way to handle the situation might be to say that the ordinary choices that get the story going are special ones, or are restricted in some way; perhaps they don\\u2019t include choices intended to impede others. If I want other people to respect my choices, these should be choices that include some respect for them. In an earlier article about Kant and animals, Korsgaard considers a restriction of the argument to goals such as avoiding suffering. In the case of these goals, the attitude we each have shows that we regard the goal as objectively good, and hence good when the interests of others are at stake. Alternatively, or as well, the kind of respect we should give each other, based on all this, might be very minimal \\u2013 perhaps it\\u2019s just that each of us should not interfere in what others are doing without good reason. That\\u2019s all fine, but none of it makes much difference. We can make all these concessions \\u2013 only considering goals that aren\\u2019t selfish and disruptive, only looking for minimal respect from others \\u2013 and there\\u2019s still no leverage being gained here, of the kind that should get other people on board with your projects, or you on board with theirs. The picture of how we are supposed to end up behaving does look sensible when we apply it to non-interference and preventing suffering. Surely that sort of thing is OK? Yes, that sort of thing is OK, but not because of a story showing that you have to think something like this in order to make sense of your own ordinary decisions. Part of what is going on is an attempt to leverage the inevitable sociability of human life into respect for the goals of others. We are indeed social beings; there is a good deal of fantasy and myth in the idea of a wholly hedonistic and ego-centred person. But that does not tell us what attitude to have to the projects of those around us. The mathematical field of \\u2018game theory\\u2019 is partly about the fact that, while the outcomes of our choices are usually dependent on what others do, we only sometimes have incentive to act in ways that maintain the sociality we all benefit from. The Kantian project was an attempt to turn some hidden assumptions underlying ordinary action into something that fosters a kind of human moral community. For Korsgaard, this leads to a further moral revolution, with every supermarket transformed. Kantian ethics, especially as Korsgaard handles it, is a vast construction erected on a tiny point, on miraculously little. But no miracle is possible here. Where do we go from here? If we give up on arguments like this, what comes next? I\\u2019ll sketch some outlines of another view, beginning, as Korsgaard does, with general ideas about choice, valuation and moral concepts. In trying to understand the business of moral thinking and debate, philosophers have tended to work with alternatives that have a kind of tidiness. Are we uncovering and describing a special set of facts? Are we instead expressing emotional responses, or engaged in elaborate attempts to direct others\\u2019 behaviours \\u2013 prescription rather than description? These are typical alternatives. Behind some of these debates is a deeper divide between a picture in which we are discovering values and a picture in which we are constructing them. Each side feels some pull from the other, and views often try to straddle or encompass both (the Kantian view holds, in effect, that we create values but there is only one way to do it that makes sense). A different view is that the whole practice of moral thinking is more mixed-up than these pictures suggest. Roughly speaking, we\\u2019re working out what to do, how to live, what policies we will encourage and discourage in ourselves and others. The activity is forward-looking in its function. But this sorting of ways we might do things is responsive to a wide range of factors \\u2013 factual, emotive, structural. A genealogical perspective can be helpful. Human projects, from many thousands of years in prehistory, have been social projects. Humans work together, and also try to influence each other \\u2013 appraising, influencing, discouraging. Standards of behaviour, implicit and explicit, are largely responses to social life, especially to the benefits of cooperation and the temptations that lead to cooperation breaking down. Norms of this kind also become entangled with standards aimed at other kinds of behavioural regulation \\u2013 ideals of purity, for example, as the US social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has emphasised \\u2013 that are only indirectly related to cooperation and social order. Parity claims depend on which similarities between cases are seen as important and which are irrelevant What begin as tacit expectations about others\\u2019 behaviour can later become explicit rules, stated and decreed. These then become enmeshed in further forms of regulation, with the rise of more hierarchical and coercive societies, priestly castes and theologies. But they can also be brought into contact with more subversive human capacities of reasoning and reflection. Theology might be sidelined or abandoned, and new conceptions of society can arise. Changes to our picture of the world won\\u2019t dictate new rules of behaviour, but can affect them, along with changing economic arrangements and the social problems of the day. As moral responses become integrated into intellectual reflection, one thing that can affect them strongly is an ideal of parity: don\\u2019t treat similar cases entirely differently. If we treat this situation as bad, then we should do likewise here, as the two cases are similar in the ways that look important. When parity is massively flouted, rules look arbitrary and cannot be defended in debate. Parity is central to the pursuit of fairness, which isn\\u2019t everything in moral life, but is one major element. Through this process of change, there remains a good deal of freedom at both individual and societal levels. We can choose how smoothly integrated with the rest of our thinking we want our moral orientation to be \\u2013 some people don\\u2019t mind a fair bit of separation. Parity claims are dependent on which similarities between cases are seen as important and which are irrelevant; they depend on our rather flexible sense of what is similar to what. As another Harvard philosopher, John Rawls, argued, we are also continually balancing the appeal of general principles with the strong reactions we have to individual cases, and that balance can usually be achieved in a variety of ways. That is my rough picture. The point of the activity of moral judgment is forward-looking \\u2013 working out what to do \\u2013 but the \\u2018inputs\\u2019 at work are diverse, sensitive to factors such as parity and consistency, as well as empathy, reverence and more. The claims we make have a form that allows them to be applied retrospectively as well as in planning and persuasion, and the \\u2018moral\\u2019 or \\u2018ethical\\u2019 is not a category neatly marked out from the rest of the larger project of trying to work out what to do. How does all this apply to questions about our treatment of animals? The situation is one where we are looking for ways to extend a framework that has been shaped primarily as a human social tool, into an area where we have new kinds of relationships to think about. The problem has become urgent because of the building pressure of parity arguments, because of new knowledge about what animal experience seems to be like, and perhaps also because of the extraordinary levels of control we have acquired over many animals in recent times, giving rise to a heightened sense that something has gone wrong. When we try to resolve all this, and work out what to do, is it reasonable to expect that a single best course of action will become visible? It might \\u2013 I\\u2019d not rule this out. But this might instead be a situation where we find a number of different reasonable paths forward, different ways to resolve the tensions. Classic moral theories such as utilitarianism, with definite rules and ways of ranking options, will be included in these paths, along with others a little more unkempt. These paths will yield different pictures of what the ideal might be, the best place we could end up. Should we retain and reform animal farming, or end it altogether? One vision of the ideal, extreme but seriously considered, is for humans to largely disengage from the lives of other animals. In this view, avoiding exploitation is a central goal and, although not all forms of entanglement of our lives with theirs are exploitative, a great many are. The ideal is then to let them be, with very few exceptions. Korsgaard\\u2019s view tends in this direction, though with companion animals explicitly ruled in \\u2013 perhaps a slightly unkempt aspect of her own view. A different goal is for us to retain much more involvement in animal lives, including farming, but find ways to do this differently \\u2013 to use our unique human powers in a way that is good, on balance, for both sides. Suppose we do get used to the idea of a range of reasonable paths in this area. Is it possible to recover, within a framework like this, the idea that the worst excesses and cruelties \\u2013 including some that are common in modern farming \\u2013 are a kind of abomination or, in Korsgaard\\u2019s terms, a \\u2018moral atrocity\\u2019? Are there practices that we just have to change? If so, where does that \\u2018have to\\u2019 come from? Sentience itself very probably exists in borderline forms and by degree; it is not a matter of yes or no I do think some cases have a special status, which can be described as follows. The process of rethinking and reform I\\u2019m describing here can go in a number of different directions, but some kinds of mistreatment of animals are special, because on nearly any reasonable extension of our thinking, taking into account the facts on hand, we would reach the conclusion that we should stop doing these things. The fact that there is a good deal of leeway or elbow room in how concepts formed in human interaction might be extended to animals, and what our ultimate goal might be, does not always leave us unable to draw strong conclusions about particular cases. A conclusion such as the need to end factory farming can be a point of intersection or convergence across many different ways of extending our practices of moral evaluation. The paths also diverge. The US photographer Isa Leshko\\u2019s beautiful book Allowed to Grow Old: Portraits of Elderly Animals from Farm Sanctuaries (2019) contains what the title suggests: old pigs, chickens, cows, sheep \\u2013 animals we rarely see at old age, as most farmed animals die very young \\u2013 along with some horses and dogs, which we are more used to at this stage in life. The images are moving, and the animals seem to have a quiet dignity. The situations pictured also contain an incongruity to reflect on. The animals are in many cases presented as escapees from human misuse, which they are. But dignity in old age will also rather rarely be a feature of animal life in the wild. Some wild animals can approach this station \\u2013 old sea turtles, serene in the water column, are beautiful to encounter in a way reminiscent of Leshko\\u2019s photos. Some birds and fish can get very old. For most mammals, it\\u2019s harder, especially relatives of the ones in Leshko\\u2019s book. For those animals, the possibility of a life of the kind pictured \\u2013 reduced in powers, but at peace \\u2013 is a product of human choice and intervention. This is the best side of the \\u2018custodial\\u2019 relationship that can exist between humans and nonhumans. The point is not that these rare peaceful sanctuary lives might override the evils of the intensive farming operations where other animals are found. It\\u2019s coherent to claim that farming can\\u2019t be reformed, except on very small scales, and an ideal future might hence not contain animals of these kinds at all. But the photos do show what can happen when human powers are used differently, as they might be on much reformed farms. These animals are a pointer to the idea of better, highly engaged relationships. People sometimes dismiss arguments for ameliorating the lives of animals because these ideal outcomes are unclear. And some of the hard questions in this area will stay hard or get harder. Views presently looking to change our relationships with animals often focus on the category of sentience, where some animals are inside this category, deserving protection, and others are outside. But sentience itself is very probably something that exists in borderline forms and by degree; it is not a matter of yes or no. Something part-way to sentience \\u2013 hemi-demi-sentience, as the US philosopher Daniel Dennett would call it \\u2013 is probably present in vast numbers of tiny invertebrate animals around us. How are concern and protection to be conceived in cases like those? But the fact that we can\\u2019t tie up every question does not prevent a proactive approach to issues that many paths forward from here will agree on. Once we accept that extensions of concern to other animals are not forced on us by the nature of reasonableness itself, as Korsgaard hoped, there is a temptation to say that everything here is a matter of feelings and emotional responses. There is more to it than that. We can choose to seek a greater measure of consistency, as well as benevolence, in our overall outlook. We have made these moves in the past \\u2013 setting out from habits and norms that function in ancient forms of social life, becoming encrusted with theology and coercion in many cases but sometimes breaking free, integrating with our evolving picture of the world and what we are about, and guided, fitfully and fallibly, by parity. We can take the process further, if we choose to, and rethink our relationships with animals. \",\n          \"Horse-and-human teams perform complex manoeuvres in competitions of all sorts. Together, we can gallop up to obstacles standing 8 feet (2.4 metres) high, leave the ground, and fly blind \\u2013 neither party able to see over the top until after the leap has been initiated. Adopting a flatter trajectory with greater speed, horse and human sail over broad jumps up to 27 feet (more than 8 metres) long. We run as one at speeds of 44 miles per hour (nearly 70 km/h), the fastest velocity any land mammal carrying a rider can achieve. In freestyle dressage events, we dance in place to the rhythm of music, trot sideways across the centre of an arena with huge leg-crossing steps, and canter in pirouettes with the horse\\u2019s front feet circling her hindquarters. Galloping again, the best horse-and-human teams can slide 65 feet (nearly 20 metres) to a halt while resting all their combined weight on the horse\\u2019s hind legs. Endurance races over extremely rugged terrain test horses and riders in journeys that traverse up to 500 miles (805 km) of high-risk adventure. Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro, a world-record dressage freestyle at London Olympia, 2014: an example of high-precision brain-to-brain communication between horse and rider. Every step the horse takes is determined in conjunction with many invisible cues from his human rider, using a feedback loop between predator brain and prey brain. Note the horse\\u2019s beautiful physical condition and complete willingness to perform these extremely difficult manoeuvres.No one disputes the athleticism fuelling these triumphs, but few people comprehend the mutual cross-species interaction that is required to accomplish them. The average horse weighs 1,200 pounds (more than 540 kg), makes instantaneous movements, and can become hysterical in a heartbeat. Even the strongest human is unable to force a horse to do anything she doesn\\u2019t want to do. Nor do good riders allow the use of force in training our magnificent animals. Instead, we hold ourselves to the higher standard of motivating horses to cooperate freely with us in achieving the goals of elite sports as well as mundane chores. Under these conditions, the horse trained with kindness, expertise and encouragement is a willing, equal participant in the action. That action is rooted in embodied perception and the brain. In mounted teams, horses, with prey brains, and humans, with predator brains, share largely invisible signals via mutual body language. These signals are received and transmitted through peripheral nerves leading to each party\\u2019s spinal cord. Upon arrival in each brain, they are interpreted, and a learned response is generated. It, too, is transmitted through the spinal cord and nerves. This collaborative neural action forms a feedback loop, allowing communication from brain to brain in real time. Such conversations allow horse and human to achieve their immediate goals in athletic performance and everyday life. In a very real sense, each species\\u2019 mind is extended beyond its own skin into the mind of another, with physical interaction becoming a kind of neural dance. Horses in nature display certain behaviours that tempt observers to wonder whether competitive manoeuvres truly require mutual communication with human riders. For example, the feral horse occasionally hops over a stream to reach good food or scrambles up a slope of granite to escape predators. These manoeuvres might be thought the precursors to jumping or rugged trail riding. If so, we might imagine that the performance horse\\u2019s extreme athletic feats are innate, with the rider merely a passenger steering from above. If that were the case, little requirement would exist for real-time communication between horse and human brains. In fact, though, the feral hop is nothing like the trained leap over a competition jump, usually commenced from short distances at high speed. Today\\u2019s Grand Prix jump course comprises about 15 obstacles set at sharp angles to each other, each more than 5 feet high and more than 6 feet wide (1.5 x 1.8 metres). The horse-and-human team must complete this course in 80 or 90 seconds, a time allowance that makes for acute turns, diagonal flight paths and high-speed exits. Comparing the wilderness hop with the show jump is like associating a flintstone with a nuclear bomb. Horses and riders undergo many years of daily training to achieve this level of performance, and their brains share neural impulses throughout each experience. These examples originate in elite levels of horse sport, but the same sort of interaction occurs in pastures, arenas and on simple trails all over the world. Any horse-and-human team can develop deep bonds of mutual trust, and learn to communicate using body language, knowledge and empathy. Like it or not, we are the horse\\u2019s evolutionary enemy, yet they behave toward us as if inclined to become a friend The critical component of the horse in nature, and her ability to learn how to interact so precisely with a human rider, is not her physical athleticism but her brain. The first precise magnetic resonance image of a horse\\u2019s brain appeared only in 2019, allowing veterinary neurologists far greater insight into the anatomy underlying equine mental function. As this new information is disseminated to horse trainers and riders for practical application, we see the beginnings of a revolution in brain-based horsemanship. Not only will this revolution drive competition to higher summits of success, and animal welfare to more humane levels of understanding, it will also motivate scientists to research the unique compatibility between prey and predator brains. Nowhere else in nature do we see such intense and intimate collaboration between two such disparate minds. Three natural features of the equine brain are especially important when it comes to mind-melding with humans. First, the horse\\u2019s brain provides astounding touch detection. Receptor cells in the horse\\u2019s skin and muscles transduce \\u2013 or convert \\u2013 external pressure, temperature and body position to neural impulses that the horse\\u2019s brain can understand. They accomplish this with exquisite sensitivity: the average horse can detect less pressure against her skin than even a human fingertip can. Second, horses in nature use body language as a primary medium of daily communication with each other. An alpha mare has only to flick an ear toward a subordinate to get him to move away from her food. A younger subordinate, untutored in the ear flick, receives stronger body language \\u2013 two flattened ears and a bite that draws blood. The notion of animals in nature as kind, gentle creatures who never hurt each other is a myth. Third, by nature, the equine brain is a learning machine. Untrammelled by the social and cognitive baggage that human brains carry, horses learn in a rapid, pure form that allows them to be taught the meanings of various human cues that shape equine behaviour in the moment. Taken together, the horse\\u2019s exceptional touch sensitivity, natural reliance on body language, and purity of learning form the tripod of support for brain-to-brain communication that is so critical in extreme performance. One of the reasons for budding scientific fascination with neural horse-and-human communication is the horse\\u2019s status as a prey animal. Their brains and bodies evolved to survive completely different pressures than our human physiologies. For example, horse eyes are set on either side of their head for a panoramic view of the world, and their horizontal pupils allow clear sight along the horizon but fuzzy vision above and below. Their eyes rotate to maintain clarity along the horizon when their heads lie sideways to reach grass in odd locations. Equine brains are also hardwired to stream commands directly from the perception of environmental danger to the motor cortex where instant evasion is carried out. All of these features evolved to allow the horse to survive predators. Conversely, human brains evolved in part for the purpose of predation \\u2013 hunting, chasing, planning\\u2026 yes, even killing \\u2013 with front-facing eyes, superb depth perception, and a prefrontal cortex for strategy and reason. Like it or not, we are the horse\\u2019s evolutionary enemy, yet they behave toward us as if inclined to become a friend. The fact that horses and humans can communicate neurally without the external mediation of language or equipment is critical to our ability to initiate the cellular dance between brains. Saddles and bridles are used for comfort and safety, but bareback and bridleless competitions prove they aren\\u2019t necessary for highly trained brain-to-brain communication. Scientific efforts to communicate with predators such as dogs and apes have often been hobbled by the use of artificial media including human speech, sign language or symbolic lexigram. By contrast, horses allow us to apply a medium of communication that is completely natural to their lives in the wild and in captivity. The horse\\u2019s prey brain is designed to notice and evade predators. How ironic, and how riveting, then, that this prey brain is the only one today that shares neural communication with a predator brain. It offers humanity a rare view into a prey animal\\u2019s world, almost as if we were wolves riding elk or coyotes mind-melding with cottontail bunnies. Highly trained horses and riders send and receive neural signals using subtle body language. For example, a rider can apply invisible pressure with her left inner calf muscle to move the horse laterally to the right. That pressure is felt on the horse\\u2019s side, in his skin and muscle, via proprioceptive receptor cells that detect body position and movement. Then the signal is transduced from mechanical pressure to electrochemical impulse, and conducted up peripheral nerves to the horse\\u2019s spinal cord. Finally, it reaches the somatosensory cortex, the region of the brain responsible for interpreting sensory information. Riders can sometimes guess that an invisible object exists by detecting subtle equine reactions This interpretation is dependent on the horse\\u2019s knowledge that a particular body signal \\u2013 for example, inward pressure from a rider\\u2019s left calf \\u2013 is associated with a specific equine behaviour. Horse trainers spend years teaching their mounts these associations. In the present example, the horse has learned that this particular amount of pressure, at this speed and location, under these circumstances, means \\u2018move sideways to the right\\u2019. If the horse is properly trained, his motor cortex causes exactly that movement to occur. By means of our human motion and position sensors, the rider\\u2019s brain now senses that the horse has changed his path rightward. Depending on the manoeuvre our rider plans to complete, she will then execute invisible cues to extend or collect the horse\\u2019s stride as he approaches a jump that is now centred in his vision, plant his right hind leg and spin in a tight fast circle, push hard off his hindquarters to chase a cow, or any number of other movements. These cues are combined to form that mutual neural dance, occurring in real time, and dependent on natural body language alone. The example of a horse moving a few steps rightward off the rider\\u2019s left leg is extremely simplistic. When you imagine a horse and rider clearing a puissance wall of 7.5 feet (2.4 metres), think of the countless receptor cells transmitting bodily cues between both brains during approach, flight and exit. That is mutual brain-to-brain communication. Horse and human converse via body language to such an extreme degree that they are able to accomplish amazing acts of understanding and athleticism. Each of their minds has extended into the other\\u2019s, sending and receiving signals as if one united brain were controlling both bodies. Franke Sloothaak on Optiebeurs Golo, a world-record puissance jump at Chaudfontaine in Belgium, 1991. This horse-and-human team displays the gentle encouragement that brain-to-brain communication requires. The horse is in perfect condition and health. The rider offers soft, light hands, and rides in perfect balance with the horse. He carries no whip, never uses his spurs, and employs the gentlest type of bit \\u2013 whose full acceptance is evidenced by the horse\\u2019s foamy mouth and flexible neck. The horse is calm but attentive before and after the leap, showing complete willingness to approach the wall without a whiff of coercion. The first thing the rider does upon landing is pat his equine teammate. He strokes or pats the horse another eight times in the next 30 seconds, a splendid example of true horsemanship.Analysis of brain-to-brain communication between horses and humans elicits several new ideas worthy of scientific notice. Because our minds interact so well using neural networks, horses and humans might learn to borrow neural signals from the party whose brain offers the highest function. For example, horses have a 340-degree range of view when holding their heads still, compared with a paltry 90-degree range in humans. Therefore, horses can see many objects that are invisible to their riders. Yet riders can sometimes guess that an invisible object exists by detecting subtle equine reactions. Specifically, neural signals from the horse\\u2019s eyes carry the shape of an object to his brain. Those signals are transferred to the rider\\u2019s brain by a well-established route: equine receptor cells in the retina lead to equine detector cells in the visual cortex, which elicits an equine motor reaction that is then sensed by the rider\\u2019s human body. From there, the horse\\u2019s neural signals are transmitted up the rider\\u2019s spinal cord to the rider\\u2019s brain, and a perceptual communication loop is born. The rider\\u2019s brain can now respond neurally to something it is incapable of seeing, by borrowing the horse\\u2019s superior range of vision. These brain-to-brain transfers are mutual, so the learning equine brain should also be able to borrow the rider\\u2019s vision, with its superior depth perception and focal acuity. This kind of neural interaction results in a horse-and-human team that can sense far more together than either party can detect alone. In effect, they share effort by assigning labour to the party whose skills are superior at a given task. There is another type of skillset that requires a particularly nuanced cellular dance: sharing attention and focus. Equine vigilance allowed horses to survive 56 million years of evolution \\u2013 they had to notice slight movements in tall grasses or risk becoming some predator\\u2019s dinner. Consequently, today it\\u2019s difficult to slip even a tiny change past a horse, especially a young or inexperienced animal who has not yet been taught to ignore certain sights, sounds and smells. By contrast, humans are much better at concentration than vigilance. The predator brain does not need to notice and react instantly to every stimulus in the environment. In fact, it would be hampered by prey vigilance. While reading this essay, your brain sorts away the sound of traffic past your window, the touch of clothing against your skin, the sight of the masthead that says \\u2018Aeon\\u2019 at the top of this page. Ignoring these distractions allows you to focus on the content of this essay. Horses and humans frequently share their respective attentional capacities during a performance. A puissance horse galloping toward an enormous wall cannot waste vigilance by noticing the faces of each person in the audience. Likewise, the rider cannot afford to miss a loose dog that runs into the arena outside her narrow range of vision and focus. Each party helps the other through their primary strengths. Such sharing becomes automatic with practice. With innumerable neural contacts over time, the human brain learns to heed signals sent by the equine brain that say, in effect: \\u2018Hey, what\\u2019s that over there?\\u2019 Likewise, the equine brain learns to sense human neural signals that counter: \\u2018Let\\u2019s focus on this gigantic wall right here.\\u2019 Each party sends these messages by body language and receives them by body awareness through two spinal cords, then interprets them inside two brains, millisecond by millisecond. The rider\\u2019s physical cues are transmitted by neural activation from the horse\\u2019s surface receptors to the horse\\u2019s brain Finally, it is conceivable that horse and rider can learn to share features of executive function \\u2013 the human brain\\u2019s ability to set goals, plan steps to achieve them, assess alternatives, make decisions and evaluate outcomes. Executive function occurs in the prefrontal cortex, an area that does not exist in the equine brain. Horses are excellent at learning, remembering and communicating \\u2013 but they do not assess, decide, evaluate or judge as humans do. Shying is a prominent equine behaviour that might be mediated by human executive function in well-trained mounts. When a horse of average size shies away from an unexpected stimulus, riders are sitting on top of 1,200 pounds of muscle that suddenly leaps sideways off all four feet and lands five yards away. It\\u2019s a frightening experience, and often results in falls that lead to injury or even death. The horse\\u2019s brain causes this reaction automatically by direct connection between his sensory and motor cortices. Though this possibility must still be studied by rigorous science, brain-to-brain communication suggests that horses might learn to borrow small glimmers of executive function through neural interaction with the human\\u2019s prefrontal cortex. Suppose that a horse shies from an umbrella that suddenly opens. By breathing steadily, relaxing her muscles, and flexing her body in rhythm with the horse\\u2019s gait, the rider calms the animal using body language. Her physical cues are transmitted by neural activation from his surface receptors to his brain. He responds with body language in which his muscles relax, his head lowers, and his frightened eyes return to their normal size. The rider feels these changes with her body, which transmits the horse\\u2019s neural signals to the rider\\u2019s brain. From this point, it\\u2019s only a very short step \\u2013 but an important one \\u2013 to the transmission and reception of neural signals between the rider\\u2019s prefrontal cortex (which evaluates the unexpected umbrella) and the horse\\u2019s brain (which instigates the leap away from that umbrella). In practice, to reduce shying, horse trainers teach their young charges to slow their reactions and seek human guidance. Brain-to-brain communication between horses and riders is an intricate neural dance. These two species, one prey and one predator, are living temporarily in each other\\u2019s brains, sharing neural information back and forth in real time without linguistic or mechanical mediation. It is a partnership like no other. Together, a horse-and-human team experiences a richer perceptual and attentional understanding of the world than either member can achieve alone. And, ironically, this extended interspecies mind operates well not because the two brains are similar to each other, but because they are so different. \",\n          \"I was sitting in a quiet office in the Louvre Museum in Paris, a clay tablet in my hand, using a magnifying glass to make out words that had been inscribed on it in small, careful, wedge-shaped signs known as cuneiform. It looked diminutive in my palm, just 38.5 mm (1.5 inches) wide and 33 mm (1.3 inches) tall. On it, an ancient scribe had written a list of a dozen names. What lay behind this little document? Who were the men listed? When and how did they live? More than 3,700 years ago, when the scribe used his sharp stylus to press the names into the clay, listing goods distributed to each person, these men knew one another and worked together. Many of them must have had wives and families and professions. What more could I learn about their world? At that point, I was just beginning my graduate research in ancient Middle Eastern history, but I knew I was not the first person to read this tablet. Decades before, in 1923, a French scholar named Fran\\u00e7ois Thureau-Dangin had travelled to eastern Syria, searching for the site of an ancient city called Terqa, and he had been given this tablet, along with a handful of others, and had brought them back to the Louvre. He had also attempted a short excavation of the site that proved to be Terqa, now a village on the Euphrates River called Tell Ashara, but he had no luck in his goal of finding more clay documents. Thureau-Dangin subsequently read, analysed and published the few tablets he had acquired, noting their distinctive features and likening them to others that were already known from the antiquities market. I had read and re-read his article many times before going to Paris to look at the tablets for myself. Doing research in history often feels like having a conversation with people who lived long ago, and, alone in that office at the Louvre, I was deep in an imagined dialogue with Thureau-Dangin about his interpretations. It made no difference that he died long before I was born; we shared a fascination with the history of Terqa. There with us, too, was the anonymous scribe who wrote the tablet so many thousands of years before, along with the scribes who inscribed the other tablets that Thureau-Dangin had acquired. The documents seemed to have belonged to an ancient private archive; most of them referred to a man named Gimil-Ninkarrak. Oddly, though, this list I was reading did not. Looking at the tablet more closely, however, I felt a sudden jolt of recognition. Beneath and around the cuneiform names I could make out the impressions of a seal that had been rolled across the clay, and it was one that I recognised. The seal had belonged to none other than Gimil-Ninkarrak. So this was why the tablet had been among the documents. Thureau-Dangin had, understandably, missed this. Two much clearer impressions of the seal were found long after Thureau-Dangin\\u2019s 1944 death, during more recent excavations at Terqa, and it was absolutely recognisable. Clearly Gimil-Ninkarrak had been present (and probably in a position of authority) for the creation of the list I held in my hand; he had rolled his seal on it as a sign of its official status. What could the scribes have told us about Gimil-Ninkarrak and his world? What was I getting wrong in my interpretation? My \\u2018conversation\\u2019 eventually expanded to include the contributions of many other scholars and many other ancient scribes; in the years since that visit to the Louvre, other little pieces of the puzzle of life in Terqa in the late 18th century BCE have been falling into place. I\\u2019ve even been able to reconstruct a microhistory of Gimil-Ninkarrak and his community. A microhistory is more focused than a biography; it examines a period during the life of a person (usually someone who was not particularly eminent), in order to understand some aspect of that person\\u2019s world. Often microhistories are based on documents that survived accidentally; documents that had meaning and importance at the time but are largely free of bluster and propaganda, not having been written with a future audience in mind. Through them we can almost be flies on the wall; eavesdropping on people in the past who would never have guessed that they would be remembered. Clay tablets written in cuneiform are perfectly suited to this approach to history, in part because they survive very well in the ground, so what survives wasn\\u2019t curated for us in ancient times. All kinds of documents are preserved. It also helps that hundreds of ancient individuals kept archives of personal documents in their homes. When archaeologists excavate ancient communities, the tablets are often found lying on the floors, right where they had been abandoned. Thureau-Dangin searched for the rest of Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s archive at Terqa in 1923, but he had no luck. Incredibly, though, the tablets he sought were eventually found. In the late 1970s, Giorgio Buccellati, an archaeologist and historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, began formal excavations at Terqa, heading an international team. In 1984 and 2011, Olivier Rouault, the epigrapher for the excavation, published the documents recovered during those seasons, and later became the director of the excavations there. As a result of their efforts, we now know of 14 tablets that mention Gimil-Ninkarrak, many of them found in what was apparently his house. They show that Gimil-Ninkarrak was a fascinating character, a prominent man in his community, one who had a connection to the local king, Kashtiliashu, but whose documents also provide glimpses into the lives of people who were much less prosperous and who suffered great financial and personal hardship, including a girl (to whom we shall return) named Guatum. The late 18th century BCE, when the Gimil-Ninkarrak tablets were produced, was more than 2,300 years before the birth of Muhammad, 1,200 years, even, before the beginning of the Roman Republic. But urban culture was already about 1,800 years old in the Middle East. And because people, rightly, always consider their own era modern, Gimil-Ninkarrak would not have thought of his culture as primitive or ancient. The global population at the time was only a tiny fraction of its current size, but people already lived on every continent except Antarctica. They spoke innumerable languages, and sustained themselves in many ways, including through agriculture, foraging, herding, fishing and trading. Gimil-Ninkarrak lived in what was then one of the most urban and densely populated areas in the world: the region that came to be known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and Syria), where cities and kingdoms lay in the valley of the great Euphrates and Tigris rivers. The major cities were grand; with populations in the tens of thousands, they boasted sprawling palaces, towering city walls, and temples on high platforms. The sizable city of Terqa was home to the great god of the region, a grain deity named Dagan. During Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s lifetime, the major power in Mesopotamia was a kingdom called Babylon. You may be familiar with Babylon from the Bible, when Nebuchadnezzar II was king, but that story would not unfold for more than 1,100 years. Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s era was what we call the Old Babylonian period, when the city of Babylon was just beginning its almost 1,500-year domination of what is now Iraq. The Old Babylonian empire had been forged by a king named Hammurabi, and Gimil-Ninkarrak may have been born around the end of Hammurabi\\u2019s reign. Terqa had its own line of kings, but they seem to have been in some way beholden to Babylon, which had a strong influence there. The Euphrates River, which flowed past the city, wide and murky, probably looked much the same in the 18th century BCE as it does now. The green fields of barley around the city would have been similar, too \\u2013 divided into long narrow rectangles, flanked by canals, extending across the flat river valley. The sun-browned hills of the steppe where sheep and goats grazed were visible in the distance then, as now. Fortunately, the locals discarded their household records right alongside their broken storage pots Archaeologists have not yet found the remains of the temple of Dagan, but they have uncovered many areas of the ancient city that are just as interesting \\u2013 and one of these is a neighbourhood that the archaeologists called \\u2018Area C\\u2019. It was here that they uncovered the tablets from the archive of Gimil-Ninkarrak. The excavated section consists of the foundations and walls of three or four ancient houses along a short stretch of narrow road, ending in a public square and a small shrine to a goddess of healing named Ninkarrak. I remember standing in that road soon after I arrived at Terqa, thinking of the people who had walked it so many thousands of years ago, and wondering about their lives: what were their names? How did they spend their days? What difficulties did they face? If the people of the region had not written on clay, I would have found few answers to my questions. We would know only what can be concluded from the artefacts and buildings. But, fortunately, the scribes at Terqa did write on clay, and the local men and women in this community discarded their household records right alongside their broken storage pots. Their tablets provide us with their names, along with plenty of details about their relationships, professions and institutions. In the case of Terqa, we know more about these individuals than we know about the kings who ruled their region. More than 100 tablets from Terqa have been published, and most seem to have been thrown away or simply forgotten by their owners, scattered (sometimes already in fragments) on the dirt floors, and covered up by fallen bricks, dirt, and later occupation levels. The tablets included nothing intended to impress; there were no royal inscriptions or literary works. Their contents were much more prosaic: personal letters, contracts, school exercises, lists of names of people who worked together \\u2013 just the same kinds of things you might find among someone\\u2019s papers today. The documents are full of names. Initially when I began research on these tablets, the names were all unfamiliar, all something of a blur, but the more I studied them, the more the community came to life. Hundreds of men, and a few women, are mentioned, each person usually identified by profession or by the name of their father. Many of the same people showed up in the documents over and over. They served as witnesses to one another\\u2019s contracts, they were listed as owners of adjoining fields and houses, they wrote one another letters, and they bought and sold property from one another. I analysed where the names occurred in the texts in order to reconstruct their social networks \\u2013 who appeared on the same witness lists together? Who lived next door to one another? How did brothers interact? I came to realise that the neighbourhood was home to many small landowners, and that it was dominated by five families. I was even able to reconstruct partial family trees for each of them. These texts are mundane, in a way, but also astonishing, because they provide a bright window into the lives of the people who lived in and around \\u2018Area C\\u2019. That\\u2019s our name for it anyway, but a contract for the sale of a house tells us that the public square where this house was located was called the \\u2018rebit matim\\u2019 or Square of the Land. Gimil-Ninkarrak stands out among the community of the rebit matim district; he was a prominent man who may have been closely involved with the shrine to Ninkarrak. To judge from the spots where the tablets were found that mention him, he seems to have lived in a house right next door to the shrine. Like several of his neighbours, Gimil-Ninkarrak owned at least one field \\u2013 the sale was recorded in a fragmentary contract. The earliest dated text mentioning him is, in fact, another contract recording the sale of a field, though he was not the buyer or seller in this one; his name appears in the witness list. Records of land and house transactions were often kept for a long time, centuries sometimes, in order to prove ownership, just in case anyone contested them. Occasionally they\\u2019re found in jars, kept carefully together. Two such jars of land contracts were found in a different area at Terqa. If someone did dispute a sale, the litigants would need to find the relevant contract, gather some of the original witnesses who had been named on the tablet, and go to court. If it turned out that someone had reneged on the contract\\u2019s terms, the listed punishment was harsh \\u2013 in most cases, he would have to pay 10 lbs of silver as a fine to the palace, and have hot asphalt smeared on his head. Court cases from other regions suggest that such severe penalties were rarely ever imposed, but they presumably acted as a pretty strong deterrent: 10 lbs of silver was much more than someone would earn in a lifetime, in almost any profession. At one point, Gimil-Ninkarrak probably worked for the local king, Kashtiliashu. We know very little about this king or his land, or how many people he ruled, or how far his realm extended. In fact, we don\\u2019t even know what his kingdom was called, because no royal inscriptions or documents from his court have been found. Later, the kingdom in this region was named Hana, and this may already have been the case, but no evidence has yet been found to prove it. Kashtiliashu might even have been foreign to the region (his name isn\\u2019t local). For decades, scholars have come up with theories about king Kashtiliashu \\u2013 that he was an early member of a royal family that later took over in Babylon, for example \\u2013 but I remain unconvinced. Only a handful of references to him survive and there just isn\\u2019t enough evidence yet to conclude much about him. That said, though, it does seem likely that his palace was at Terqa, the biggest city in the region. To judge from his cylinder seal, Gimil-Ninkarrak served the king as one of his personal barbers. We know of the king\\u2019s connection to Gimil-Ninkarrak because Gimil-Ninkarrak owned a beautiful cylinder seal with an inscription that describes him as the servant of Kashtiliashu. Anyone less important than the king \\u2013 that is, everyone in the kingdom \\u2013 was considered to be subservient to the king, but only people who worked directly for him could be described on their seals as servants of the king. Cylinder seals were used in much the way we use signatures; a cylinder seal rolled across a clay document indicated the involvement of the man or woman it belonged to. Gimil-Ninkarrak rolled his seal on tablets and on pieces of clay used to seal doors or pots. It\\u2019s clear from the impressions that the ends of the seal were covered by extravagant gold caps decorated with triangle designs made up of tiny gold balls, called granulation. It was probably a gift from King Kashtiliashu. A cylinder seal from Terqa. Courtesy the Louvre Museum, ParisWhat, you may be wondering, did Gimil-Ninkarrak do for the king? Ever since the 1920s when some of his tablets were first published, we\\u2019ve known his profession: he was the \\u2018chief barber\\u2019. This was how he was identified in another of the tablets that he had kept \\u2013 a broken half of a contract for the hire of a labourer to work in his fields, a man named Iddin-Sin. The contract notes that Gimil-Ninkarrak promised to pay Iddin-Sin a salary in barley, and guaranteed him 10 days off during the year. We know from other, similar, contracts that Iddin-Sin would have been given wool for his clothing, along with new sandals and a pot of oil, and that he was provided with an advance, paid in barley, at the time of hiring. Had Gimil-Ninkarrak failed to provide any of this, Iddin-Sin could have taken him to court, using the contract as evidence. Why would someone with the title of \\u2018chief barber\\u2019 own and buy fields and hire labourers to work them? In a letter, Gimil-Ninkarrak even instructed someone to buy him some draft animals, perhaps to pull a plough or wagon. If not for his cylinder seal and his professional title, you would think from his contracts that he made his living in agriculture. But in Mesopotamia 3,700 years ago, almost everyone had a connection to agriculture. Officials received the use of land from the king as a form of salary, to be worked, not by the officials themselves, but by tenant farmers, hired labourers or entrepreneurs. Soldiers were allotted smaller plots of land that they farmed when not on campaign. So Gimil-Ninkarrak owned arable land and benefited from its harvests, while also devoting himself to his profession as chief barber. In order to learn more about Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s career, I expanded my search for documents. Many professions in this era were organised into guilds, each with an administrator to oversee its members. A barber\\u2019s guild is mentioned on a clay tablet from the nearby city of Mari where \\u2018the members of the barbers\\u2019 guild take their places beside the (other) craftsmen and deposit their razors before (the goddess) Ishtar\\u2019. Gimil-Ninkarrak seems to have headed the barbers\\u2019 guild in Terqa. The razor that a barber would have used was called a naglabu in the local language of Akkadian. It was a sharp blade that was also often mentioned in association with surgery, which barbers could also perform. In another document from Mari, a letter this time, a man wrote about being taken to a barber for a pain in his foot: \\u2018my foot is in pain all over, and I cannot step on the ground. And they carried me to the house of the barber on a bed.\\u2019 Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s role as a healer of this kind might explain the location of his house, right beside a shrine to the goddess of healing, Ninkarrak. He may even have had a role in her cult. A list of names that probably records offerings made to the goddess was found on the floor of her shrine; it featured Gimil-Ninkarrak in fourth place, after the goddess herself, the king, and one other person. To judge from his cylinder seal, though, Gimil-Ninkarrak also served the king, perhaps as one of his personal barbers. Think of it; here was a man who regularly held a razor-sharp blade to the king\\u2019s throat. If so, Kashtiliashu must have trusted him completely. As a result, Gimil-Ninkarrak may have been asked to perform other roles \\u2013 ones unrelated to the shaving and trimming of hair or to surgery \\u2013 that required someone in whom the king had utter confidence. Around the same time, another chief barber had the unlikely responsibility of overseeing troops at a military fort. He worked in this capacity alongside a vizier and several military commanders. The chief barber\\u2019s title might, in the end, be misleading; it\\u2019s possible that Gimil-Ninkarrak spent more time helping to administer the local kingdom than he did chatting with clients while trimming their beards. Guatum was sold into slavery. Gimil-Ninkarrak purchased her from her parents Detailed study of the documents gives us a real sense of this man: he lived in an unassuming neighbourhood and owned land; he had a son and presumably a wife (though we know nothing about her); he was active in his community, and may have been the most influential man among his neighbours, overseeing the local barbers and working for the king. But one document from his archive contains a jarring surprise. The contract starts with the name of a girl. She was \\u2018Guatum, the daughter of Shamhu and Beltani\\u2019. Why was she the subject of this contract? The scribe continued: \\u2018Gimil-Ninkarrak, son of Arshi-ahum, bought her for her full price from Shamhu and Beltani, her father and her mother. He paid 5/6 mana of silver\\u2026.\\u2019 Although nowhere in the contract is the term for \\u2018slave\\u2019 mentioned, Guatum was certainly being sold into slavery. Gimil-Ninkarrak purchased her from her parents. A tablet from Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s archive for the purchase of Guatum from her parents. Courtesy the Louvre Museum, ParisThis tablet is unusual for its time. Mesopotamian slave sale contracts in the 18th and 17th centuries BCE more often specified that slaves came from a particular distant place than that they were bought from their parents. Occasionally, a contract records that a young woman was purchased from her parents by a couple in order to become a second wife to the husband and a slave to the wife. Although polygamy was rare, such marriages were permissible in instances in which a couple was infertile, and may have occurred when the woman\\u2019s parents could not afford a dowry. But there is no mention of marriage in Guatum\\u2019s contract. Leaving Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s world of land ownership and official duties, what can we learn about poorer people in the society, people like the family of Beltani, Shamhu and Guatum? Scribes wrote about them more rarely and they generally kept no archives. What could possibly have happened in the lives of Beltani and Shamhu that brought them to the dire decision to sell their daughter? In the 18th century BCE, there seem to have been no slave markets, but female domestic slaves did work in some households. Some had been born into slavery, some brought from distant lands, some inherited, some purchased from merchants, and some even (as in this case) sold by their own parents. The sale of a child seems to have almost always represented a last, desperate action in a time of impossible financial hardship for a family. Guatum\\u2019s parents may have seen selling their daughter as the only option that would keep her fed and alive. Generally, extended families seem to have pitched in to help when times were bad. Letters survive from this era in which adult siblings begged one another for financial assistance. This informal safety net could be lifesaving. But sometimes family members were unable to assist, as may have happened in the case of Guatum\\u2019s parents. Just occasionally, we get a glimpse of what could drive a parent to sell their child. A group of contracts from a later period \\u2013 the 13th century BCE \\u2013 records a family\\u2019s catastrophic crisis that produced a similar outcome. The documents were excavated in Emar, a city on the Euphrates to the northwest of Terqa. By the time they were written, a long period of peace and prosperity was coming to an end. Emar was suffering from famine and from attacks from outside, and scribes there referred to \\u2018the year of famine\\u2019 or \\u2018the year of distress and war\\u2019. An Old Babylonian plaque depicting an embracing couple, dating c2000-1700 BCE, shortly before Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s era. Courtesy the Met Museum, New YorkExcavators found more than 800 cuneiform tablets and inscribed fragments in Emar. Among them are a few concerning the plight of a young couple named Ku\\u2019e and Zadamma, who were not native to the city. Perhaps, since they lived away from their original home city, they had no safety net of family members to fall back on, or perhaps their whole extended family was suffering. Several scholars have discussed the lives of these family members since the documents were found, including the Italian scholar Carlo Zaccagnini in 1994 and the Polish scholar Lena Fija\\u0142kowska in 2014. I was able to learn more about why a Mesopotamian couple might sell a child from the discoveries made by these experts and from my own analysis of the tablets. Remarkably, a first-person statement by the mother, Ku\\u2019e, survives, in which she explained in her own words what happened to her and to her children. She said: My husband went away; [our children] (were all) babies [and I did not have anyone] who could feed (them). Therefore I have sold my daughter Ba\\u2019la-bia to be a daughter of Anat-ummi \\u2026 and (thus) I could feed the (other) small children (of mine) during the year of the famine.It seems that Ku\\u2019e had a young daughter and twin baby sons, her husband was gone, and she was destitute. There\\u2019s no mention of slavery here, and the little girl Ba\\u2019la-bia was \\u2018to be a daughter\\u2019 of the woman paying for her, so perhaps their arrangement represented a form of paid adoption. Anat-ummi had offered 30 shekels of silver for the girl, which was a lot of money, and Ku\\u2019e may have envisioned a life for her daughter in which she was not enslaved, while also seeing a future for herself in which she could afford to care for her boys. Archaeologists found the tiny clay footprints of the three oldest children that were mentioned here It was not to be. Anat-ummi failed to pay, so little Ba\\u2019la-bia stayed with her mother. But then Ku\\u2019e\\u2019s husband returned, Ku\\u2019e gave birth to a second baby daughter, and the dire circumstances of war and famine no doubt made things worse. Perhaps they all faced starvation. The parents finally made the decision that they must have been dreading. Another contract from Emar tells their tale: Zadamma and Ku\\u2019e, his wife, have sold their two sons and their two daughters \\u2013 Ba\\u2019la-bia, Ba\\u2019la-belu, Ishma\\u2019-Dagan, and Ba\\u2019la-ummi, a daughter at the breast \\u2013 into slavery for 60 shekels of silver, the entire price, to Ba\\u2019lu-malik, the diviner.All four of their children were sold to a rich man, one of the town\\u2019s leaders. What would their lives have been like? We have no way to know. It is safe (and tragic) to assume that they were not reunited with their parents, because the contract continued: \\u2018If anyone sues to reclaim the four children of Zadamma, they must give 10 other persons as compensation to Ba\\u2019lu-malik.\\u2019 Ku\\u2019e and Zadamma could never have afforded to provide those \\u201810 other (enslaved) persons\\u2019 in exchange for their children. Drawing of the clay feet impressions by Amanda H PodanyAt the end of the contract, the scribe noted \\u2018And now Zadamma, their father, and Ku\\u2019e, their mother, have pressed their feet into clay.\\u2019 Incredibly, archaeologists found the tiny clay footprints of the three oldest children that were mentioned here. Each was sealed and witnessed like a normal legal document, with the writing and seal impressions squeezed in around the little footprints. The misery of the parents and children seems so immediate when you look at them. The children would have had no concept, on the day when their parents helped them to step on those pieces of clay, of how their lives were about to change entirely. Perhaps a similarly tragic story lay behind the decision of Guatum\\u2019s parents to sell her to Gimil-Ninkarrak. At Emar this practice of selling children was not normal; it was seen as extreme and required justification. The same was probably true elsewhere. Fortunately, Mesopotamian culture offered other ways for an individual or family to climb out of financial crisis. Someone struggling, and failing, to support themselves could request a loan of silver or barley from a wealthy person or temple. A loan document was found in a house across the street from Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s home in Terqa. It records that the homeowner, a man named Puzurum, had borrowed 5\\u00bd shekels of silver from the temple of the god Shamash, and promised to pay back the silver and interest \\u2018when he is healthy and solvent\\u2019. The small tablet had been carefully split in half lengthwise, suggesting that the loan described in it had been paid off. The scribe didn\\u2019t record the interest rate, but we know from other contracts that interest rates were often prohibitively high. In his laws, King Hammurabi of Babylon had tried to regulate them. He prescribed an eye-popping interest rate of 33 per cent on barley and 20 per cent on silver. I\\u2019m sure Puzurum was very relieved to have managed to pay off his debt to the temple. He would have kept that cancelled loan tablet in his house just in case there might be any doubt. As you might imagine, with interest rates so high, many people found themselves in a much tougher position than Puzurum. A farmer might have borrowed barley for sowing fields and then found that, for any number of reasons, the fields that year didn\\u2019t produce enough to pay back the loan with interest. If the farmer had no extended family wealthy enough to help make the payments, there was an option, but it was a stark one: they (or a family member) could become pledged or even enslaved to the creditor for a fixed time while performing labour to work off the debt. But at least debt slaves couldn\\u2019t be bought and sold and, once the agreed term ended, they were freed. This manumission took place after three years of service, according to one of Hammurabi\\u2019s laws, though the law was not necessarily followed. The kings of this era also often issued a general decree at the beginning of their reign in which they cancelled debts for the whole population, resulting in a mass release of debt slaves. This was no doubt a popular move. If Guatum\\u2019s sale resulted from her parents\\u2019 debts, perhaps she too was released on such an occasion. The clay tablets they left behind allow us to trace their relationships and analyse their decisions It was not just men, like Puzurum, who incurred debts. Women, too, could take out loans in their own names. Cuneiform tablets from this period show that, although women did not have equal standing with men, they could own property (and pass it down to their children), represent themselves in court, hold professions, and receive pay for their work. Few women are named in the tablets from the rebit matim neighbourhood, but a fragment of another contract from Puzurum\\u2019s house lists three women among the five preserved names of witnesses to a sale. The first was named Hamishtartum, then came Tupi, who was described as the daughter of a man named Meptu, and lastly Ahat-Kubi, daughter of Bina-Hammi. When women witnessed a contract, it was often because one (or more) of the principal parties to the transaction was also a woman. Although that section of the contract is lost in this case, probably a woman was either the buyer or the seller of the property, and her friends or relatives \\u2013 Hamishtartum, Tupi, and Ahat-Kubi \\u2013 had agreed to witness the transaction. They were therefore willing to go to court if the sale was challenged at all in the future. Women and men would have mingled together when the contract was written and there\\u2019s no sign that women were prevented from participating in town events and society. The female buyer or seller was probably a member of Puzurum\\u2019s family, given that the contract was discovered in his house alongside his other documents, and, as it turns out, the witnesses Tupi and Ahat-Kubi almost certainly were acquainted with Gimil-Ninkarrak. We know this because (in a text from Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s archive) Ahat-Kubi\\u2019s father and Gimil-Ninkarrak\\u2019s son were listed as owning adjoining fields, and Tupi\\u2019s brother was a witness when one of those fields was sold. The land-owning families in the rebit matim neighbourhood at Terqa, such as those of Gimil-Ninkarrak and Puzurum, lived and worked alongside families who struggled to make ends meet. I think they would all be astounded to know that, more than 3,700 years later, the clay tablets they left behind allow us to trace their relationships and analyse their decisions, and that their lives help us to understand their long-lost culture. Cuneiform archives like these combine to show us that the ancient Middle East was populated by men, women and children who worked and socialised, loved their families and friends, struggled through adversity, and were as real and human as ourselves. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input_ids\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attention_mask\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Evaluation data:')\n","valData.head(2)"],"metadata":{"id":"39Yup9lD7ObC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":164},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730999674119,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Mai Ngo","userId":"00292170341618798690"}},"outputId":"1aab8f39-b121-49cf-f356-5604474ef210"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Evaluation data:\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       title                                        description  \\\n","0  Education  What would happen if the aid industry started ...   \n","1     Gender  History is full of sorrowful knights, sobbing ...   \n","\n","                                               essay  \\\n","0  Just like words on a page or paint on a canvas...   \n","1  One of our most firmly entrenched ideas of mas...   \n","\n","                                           input_ids  \\\n","0  [21603, 10, 1142, 114, 1234, 30, 3, 9, 543, 42...   \n","1  [21603, 10, 555, 13, 69, 167, 3, 16804, 1721, ...   \n","\n","                                      attention_mask  \\\n","0  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...   \n","1  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...   \n","\n","                                              labels  \n","0  [363, 133, 1837, 3, 99, 8, 3052, 681, 708, 108...  \n","1  [5528, 19, 423, 13, 27225, 1329, 29816, 7, 6, ...

By 1995, he had turned $50 into $40 million, in what has become known as the biggest winning streak in gambling history. Most of us would call it an instance of great luck, or we might say of Archie himself: \\u2018What a lucky guy!\\u2019 The cold-hearted statistician would laugh at our superstious notions, and instead describe a series of chance processes that happened to work out for Karas. In the larger landscape where randomness reigns, anything can happen at any given casino. Calling its beneficiaries lucky is simply sticking a label on it after the fact. To investigate luck is to take on one of the grandest of all questions: how can we explain what happens to us, and whether we will be winners, losers or somewhere in the middle at love, work, sports, gambling and life overall? As it turns out, new findings suggest that luck is not a phenomenon that appears exclusively in hindsight, like a hail storm on your wedding day. Nor is it an expression of our desire to see patterns where none exist, like a conviction that your yellow sweater is lucky. The concept of luck is not a myth. Instead, the studies show, luck can be powered by past good or bad luck, personality and, in a meta-twist, even our own ideas and beliefs about luck itself. Lucky streaks are real, but they are the product of more than just blind fate. Our ideas about luck influence the way we behave in risky situations. We really can make our own luck, though we don\\u2019t like to think of ourselves as lucky \\u2013 a descriptor that undermines other qualities, like talent and skill. Luck can be a force, but it\\u2019s one we interact with, shape and cultivate. Luck helps determine our fate here on Earth, even if you think its ultimate cause divine. Luck is perspective and point of view: if a secular man happened to survive because he took a meeting outside his office at the World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, he might simply acknowledge random chance in life without assigning a deeper meaning. A Hindu might conclude he had good karma. A Christian might say God was watching out for him so that he could fulfil a special destiny in His service. The mystic could insist he was born under lucky stars, as others are born with green eyes. Traditionally, the Chinese think luck is an inner trait, like intelligence or upbeat mood, notes Maia Young, a management expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. \\u2018My mom always used to tell me, \\u201cYou have a lucky nose\\u201d, because its particular shape was a lucky one, according to Chinese lore.\\u2019 Growing up in the American Midwest, it dawned on Young that the fleeting luck that Americans often talked about \\u2013 a luck that seemed to visit the same person at certain times (\\u2018I got lucky on that test!\\u2019) but not others (\\u2018I got caught in traffic before my interview!\\u2019) \\u2013 was not equivalent to the unchanging, stable luck her mother saw in her daughter, her nose being an advertisement of its existence within. \\u2018It\\u2019s something that I have that\\u2019s a possession of mine, that can be more relied upon than just dumb luck,\\u2019 says Young. The distinction stuck with her. You might think someone with a lucky nose wouldn\\u2019t roll up their sleeves to work hard \\u2013 why bother? \\u2013 but here\\u2019s another cultural difference in perceptions of luck. \\u2018In Chinese culture,\\u2019 she says, \\u2018hard work can go hand-in-hand with being lucky. The belief system accommodates both.\\u2019 On the other hand, because Westerners see effort and good fortune as taking up opposite corners of the ring, they are ambivalent about luck. They might pray for it and sincerely wish others they care about \\u2018Good luck!\\u2019 but sometimes they just don\\u2019t want to think of themselves as lucky. They\\u2019d rather be deserving. The fact that they live in a society that is neither random nor wholly meritocratic makes for an even messier slamdance between \\u2018hard work\\u2019 and \\u2018luck\\u2019. Case in point: when a friend gets into a top law or medical school, we might say: \\u2018Congratulations! You\\u2019ve persevered. You deserve it.\\u2019 Were she not to get in, we would say: \\u2018Acceptance is arbitrary. Everyone\\u2019s qualified these days \\u2013 it\\u2019s the luck of the draw.\\u2019 Scientists researching luck often look to sports, where chance plays a role in even the most skill-reliant competitions, and outcomes are easy to measure. One of the most studied phenomena in the field is lucky streaks, where players seem to be on fire, so to speak \\u2013 hence the official term for it, \\u2018hot hands\\u2019. A landmark paper by the Stanford psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky, published in 1985, declared that the hot hand did not exist and was instead an illusion born of that deep-seated tendency to see patterns in our environments. Players and fans disputed the finds, and researchers dubbed their insistence \\u2018the Hot-Hand Fallacy\\u2019. Last year, however, three Harvard University students caused big trouble for hot-hand deniers. Andrew Bocskocsky, John Ezekowitz and Carolyn Stein reasoned that, once a player is hot, he might be emboldened to take more difficult shots, thereby \\u2018cancelling out\\u2019 the hot-hands effect. (Previous studies falsely assumed a random assortment of shots by players.) The students got hold of a video consisting of 83,000 shot attempts from the 2012-13 US National Basketball Association season, giving them enough information to assess the difficulty of the shots. They showed, first of all, that players who felt \\u2018hot\\u2019 did in fact start taking harder shots. And, after controlling for the difficulty of each shot selected, they found a small yet significant hot-hands effect \\u2013 that is, those who did well began to do even better over time. Around the same time, another group, Jeffrey Zwiebel of Stanford and Brett Green of the University of California, Berkeley, found that opponents strengthen their defence against hot players \\u2013 thereby acting against a hot-hands effect. Previous research didn\\u2019t have enough data to take this into account sufficiently, and thus interpreted any decline in a hot player\\u2019s performance as proof that he was not on a streak. Could good luck beget good luck and bad luck really beget bad luck? Given this impediment, Zweibel and Green decided to look at the sport of baseball, where an opposing team can\\u2019t do as much to frustrate a hitter on a roll. They were on to something: when they analysed 12 years of data from Major League Baseball, they found that how a player performed the most recent 25 times at bat was a significant predictor of how he would do the next time. They also calculated that a hot player was 30 per cent more likely to get a home run than if he were not on a winning streak. Lucky streaks are real and not just an illusion, they said. But what causes them? Is it truly luck, or something else? Perhaps it comes down to the odds. That\\u2019s the suggestion from research into both winning and losing streaks from University College London. Researchers Juemin Xu and Nigel Harvey analysed about half a million sports bets (courtesy of an online gambling company) and found that those on winning streaks were much more likely than not to keep winning, and those on losing streaks were more likely to keep losing than 50/50 chances would dictate. For example, a gambler who had just won three times in a row, won 67 per cent of the time on his fourth bet. If he won on his fourth bet, then he cleaned up 72 per cent of the time on the fifth bet. Those who lost their first bets were just 47 per cent likely to win on the second and, if they lost again, only 45 per cent likely to win on the third. Could good luck beget good luck and bad luck really beget bad luck, just as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? The team then dug deeper to reveal why these streaks were in fact real: it was the bettors\\u2019 own doing. As soon as they realised they were winning, they made safer bets, figuring their streaks could not last forever. In other words, they did not believe themselves to have hot hands that would stay hot. A different impulse drove gamblers who lost. Sure that lady luck was due for a visit, they fell for the gambler\\u2019s fallacy and made riskier bets. As a result, the winners kept winning (even if the amounts they won were small) and the losers kept losing. Risky bets are less likely to pay off than safe ones. The gamblers changed their behaviours because of their feelings about streaks, which in turn perpetuated those streaks. If behaviour influences luck, do people who think of themselves as lucky behave differently from the rest of us? A 2009 study co-authored by Maia Young assessed whether students believed in stable luck as a trait they themselves possessed. She found a relationship between the belief in stable luck (versus fleeting luck) and measures of achievement and motivation, including whether or not the students persisted at tasks or chose challenging ones to begin with. Lucky people, it seems, are go-getters. \\u2018You can see how someone who believes in stable luck will be more motivated to pick difficult goals and then stick with them. If you believe luck is this chance, fleeting luck that you can\\u2019t rely on because it ebbs and flows, you might be less motivated to stick with hard tasks, the challenging tasks,\\u2019 explains Young. Lucky people might win at life, but their sunny outlooks could get them in trouble in Vegas Young\\u2019s finding dovetails with the work of Richard Wiseman, a former magician who is now Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire and author of the book The Luck Factor (2003). The best way to look at luck, Wiseman argues, is as a stable trait \\u2013 not one that people are born with, but one they can cultivate. Wiseman searched for people who considered themselves consistently very lucky or unlucky until he gathered 400 subjects. He found that \\u2018lucky\\u2019 people are adept at creating and noticing chance opportunities (such as meeting an important businessman at a caf\\u00e9), listen to their intuition, have positive expectations that create self-fulfilling prophesies, and have a relaxed and resilient attitude about life\\u2019s trials. Poor unlucky souls are more tense and anxious than lucky ones. Wiseman broke down the tendencies of the lucky group into behavioural interventions such as getting people to imagine how things could have been worse when they were faced with misfortune or, more generally, asking them to \\u2018switch up your daily routine\\u2019. As a result, 80 per cent of the unlucky group reported that, after just a month, they were happier, more satisfied with their lives, and yes, luckier. The more one ponders luck and the new insights into it, the more its paradoxes come cascading down, like the rows of cherries in a slot machine. Consider optimism: it was one of the key qualities of lucky people identified by Wiseman, and yet the online bettors in the study by University College London who were on a winning streak kept winning because of their pessimism. They played it safe. Wiseman\\u2019s lucky people might win at life, but their sunny outlooks could get them in trouble in Vegas. Which is exactly what happened to Archie Karas. Just three weeks after he peaked at $40 million, he lost it all. His \\u2018lucky streak\\u2019 turned into a net loss of $50. In a sad coda, in 2013 Karas was charged with burglary, winning by fraudulent means and cheating at a blackjack table in Lakeside, California. But just this November, fortune smiled on him, slightly: he was placed on probation, escaping a potential three-year prison term. Things could always be worse. \",\n          \"One summer afternoon in the city of Sumter in South Carolina, three men \\u2013 a farmer, a scholar, and a landscape architect \\u2013 stood in a field boiling watermelon juice. They had pressed the juice themselves from Bradford watermelons, a favoured fruit of the antebellum South. The Bradford has white seeds, deep ruby flesh, and a rind so soft it can be scooped with a spoon. It had been thought extinct since the early 1900s, when watermelons with tough rinds suitable for shipping displaced it. But it had been quietly growing for more than 100 years in the backyards of eight generations of Bradfords, endangered but not dead, like the African southern white rhino. Glenn Roberts (the farmer), David Shields (the scholar) and Nat Bradford (the architect, and heir to the 180-year-old Bradford watermelon breed) had been labouring under a blistering sun for most of that August day in 2013, cutting open watermelons in the dusty field, straining the seeds out, pressing and heating the liquid in a sorghum evaporator \\u2013 a huge steam pan lofted over a propane-fired field oven \\u2013 until it flared to a fiery red. Finally, towards evening, it was ready: a molasses that had not been made since the end of the Civil War. Shields recalls the taste as a revelation on the tongue. \\u2018It had a base note of sugary molasses and a middle range of this deep watermelony thing and a sort of honeysuckle top note. And I thought to myself, of all the lost melons of yesteryear, this is the one I wished would return. And it has. It\\u2019s the taste of the past but it\\u2019s also the taste of the future.\\u2019 Later that summer, 273 Bradford watermelons were juiced by hand at the High Wire Distilling company in Charleston, South Carolina. The juice was rested in barrels for three months and distilled into 143 bottles of heirloom brandy with a light, cucumber-like rind flavour and a delicate watermelon finish; they quickly sold out. In 1882 the South Carolina Pickens Sentinel had praised that brandy: \\u2018as clear as a crystal\\u2026 with an odour like that of bay rum\\u2019. The soft rinds were taken to the Culinary Institute of Charleston, pickled and packaged into 400 one\\u2011quart jars. This year, Nat Bradford (who has used the watermelon proceeds to fund a freshwater mission project in Tanzania) plans to grow at least 1,000 watermelons. \\u2018Tasting an heirloom cultivar prepared in the classic way is like discovering a lost masterwork,\\u2019 says Shields, a professor of literature at the University of South Carolina. \\u2018It\\u2019s like listening to Thomas Tallis\\u2019s Spem in Alium, a Renaissance choral masterpiece for eight five-part choirs. When you hear it, you sense what heaven must have sounded like then. It\\u2019s the same when you taste restored cultivars prepared using recipes of an earlier time.\\u2019 Shields is the author of Southern Provisions: The Creation and Revival of a Cuisine (2015). He and Roberts, who owns the artisan-goods purveyor Anson Mills, source grains and seeds from gardens, collections or bootlegger\\u2019s fields. Then they work with plant geneticists to authenticate them, cajole farmers to grow them, and inspire chefs to prepare them, often using historic recipes from newspapers and letters of the time. They are slowly managing to exhume and revive the golden age of the antebellum culinary past that blended African, European and American foodways \\u2013 from groundnut cakes (based on the wild African peanut brought over by slaves) to sorghum butter. The two men sum up their deep affiliation of the past decade as one long conversation \\u2013 at the centre of which is the question: can we have a canon of taste? Can we approach cuisine as we do architectural restoration, classical music or great masterworks of art? Above all, can they bring lost flavours to people who consider the culinary pursuit an art? Shields and Roberts are not alone. There is a growing global movement to establish a culinary canon and to restore the actual local ingredients that composed it. Why shouldn\\u2019t there be a canon of taste, like other canons of our civilisation, those of literature, art, music, architecture, religion and science? We have a global palate now, and with that, a new willingness to cross-pollinate and revivify regional foodways \\u2013 and even ways of staging food at the table. Even in the most unassuming places, artisanal traditions are being newly recreated: \\u2018I just came from Norwalk, Iowa, out in the middle of nowhere, and there was this incredible charcuterie,\\u2019 says the chef Dan Barber, founder of the internationally acclaimed Blue Hill restaurant in New York. The charcuterie, La Quercia, creates artisan-cured meats by hand from local, acorn-fed pork, and has become world-renowned. From Einstein to Mozart, Buddha to Van Gogh, Michelangelo to Emily Dickinson, certain works \\u2013 and their creators \\u2013 are so universally and deeply felt that they enter the realm of the immortal dead, what the 19th-century English novelist George Eliot called a \\u2018divinely human\\u2019 choir. They belong to a canon that is culturally transmitted, broadly influential and amazingly long-lived. A canon is as much about the artistic, scientific or literary power of a work as it is about popularity. Canons are not simply pure expressions of cultural power; they are phenomena of cultural psychology, according to James Cutting, a psychologist at Cornell University and the author of Impressionism and its Canon (2005). Exposure markedly affects preference. We like what we have encountered before. In that way, all canons are flawed and fluid, and do not include the indisputable \\u2018best of the best\\u2019 \\u2013 but they do a pretty good job of distilling a civilisation\\u2019s high points. the grape that is distilled into Cabernet Sauvignon wine is universally praised, and its taste has become inviolate. No new grape can supplant it Even the briefest musical passage can become canonical: four notes \\u2013 three Gs and a long E-flat \\u2013 constitute the opening of Beethoven\\u2019s Fifth Symphony, a triumphant affirmation of life from a man nearly deaf at the time. And yet, history has never offered up corresponding touchstones for cuisine, nor formally measured human greatness by a good meal. We have traditionally regarded cuisines as pop or folk art at best \\u2013 cherished but ephemeral, beginning as peasant food forged from the local landscape and naturally disappearing as people emigrated and landscapes changed. A single taste can resonate down an entire lifetime like Marcel Proust\\u2019s peerless madeleine. A taste can be so revered that we try to freeze it in time: the grape that is distilled into Cabernet Sauvignon wine is universally praised, and its taste has become inviolate. No new grape can supplant it. Similarly, Shanghai once staked its reputation on the white-fleshed peaches grown in its walled gardens, and to this day the delicate peaches are wrapped individually in newspaper and consumed within hours or days of picking. They are a distant relative of the famous Georgia peach, which comes from a pollinated seedling of the Chinese clingstone peach near Shanghai. Cuisine has always been an intimate expression of a given locale\\u2019s \\u2018terroir\\u2019, the geology, climate and microbiology of the soil giving rise to the indigenous ingredients comprising its food. The culinary art flowers out of necessary skills, like foraging, hunting, fishing and trapping, all of which once intimately connected humans to the wild. Sentinel dishes infuse themselves into the culture, social mores and taste buds of a place and time. And cuisine has, of course, had its own hagiography that stretches back at least to the early 1800s, when the French chef Marie-Antoine Car\\u00eame published his five-volume survey L\\u2019Art de la cuisine fran\\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\\u00e8me si\\u00e8cle: Trait\\u00e9 \\u00e9l\\u00e9mentaire et pratique. William Kitchiner, an English optician and cookery enthusiast, wrote The Cook\\u2019s Oracle in 1822; and James Beard\\u2019s American Cookery (1972) quickly became a classic. But the increasingly popular view that taste itself can curate culture along with other cultural canons is relatively new. The psychologist Paul Rozin, who teaches a course on food at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks it has happened slowly over the past 20 years. \\u2018Cuisine was traditionally regarded as a sort of low art,\\u2019 says Rozin. \\u2018Everybody had to read Shakespeare, but nobody was required to know what Chinese cuisine consisted of. But I think that\\u2019s changing. Cuisine has become very creative. Tasting menus are becoming more and more popular. You attend a restaurant as you do a concert. The composer, in this case the chef, tells you what is on the menu, and you all experience it together.\\u2019 The steady ascendance of the culinary arts can be charted in the spread of the French Michelin Guide, which began offering a star for restaurants in 1926, eventually expanding to three stars and slowly adding guides in other countries. By 2013, the guide was selling in 90 countries, with 14 editions. The culinary conversation went global in 2002, when the World\\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, published annually by Restaurant Magazine, was established. This culinary conversation broadened with international plane travel, television shows that blended food with travel, and celebrity chefs who held forth with their own TV series and cookbooks. Cross-fertilisation of ideas became the norm. \\u2018Twenty years ago in France I was in a restaurant where a bit of Indian tandoori spicing was incorporated,\\u2019 says Marlena Spieler, an award-winning food writer from California. \\u2018Back then, it felt like a daring move for a land devoted to its own culinary tradition.\\u2019 Today, such pollination is common. Somewhere in all that exchange, a new idea was born: to explore the pure ingredients that have inspired every great cuisine. The ingredient itself \\u2013 the ineluctable thing itself, the pure taste on its own \\u2013 began to take centre-stage. As Shields points out, the technology of cooking has morphed many times in the past 200 years \\u2013 from hearthside to coal cookstove to gas range to electric and convection and microwave. Even terroir is subject to climate change and pesticides and monocropping. \\u2018The chefs lovingly cradled each peach on its way to the plate; the waiters ferried them away, walking gingerly\\u2019 One might mark 1987 as the year when a canon of taste was born, when the Barcelona chef Ferran Adri\\u00e0 was put in charge of El Bulli, a restaurant perched on a remote corner of coastal Catalonia in Spain, near the French border. It soon became the most famous restaurant in the world \\u2013 at one point staffed by 42 chefs \\u2013 and Adri\\u00e0 was compared to the Picasso of cuisine. What set him apart was his talent for reframing the canon so that the ingredient was the fundamental revelation. For example, Rozin recalls Adri\\u00e0\\u2019s pi\\u00f1a colada, made of the typical constituents, but utterly transformed: \\u2018It had pineapple juice and coconut poured over spun sugar. It was like cotton candy and melted in my mouth. It was an experience I\\u2019ll never forget.\\u2019 Adri\\u00e0 might deconstruct and reconstruct an omelette, serving potato foam, onion pur\\u00e9e and egg-white sabayon (a light, mousse-like dessert) topped with deep-fried potato crumbs in a sherry glass. The ultimate message was the delicious shock of experiencing new culinary art using canonical ingredients. Apprentices at El Bulli have taken the lesson to heart: the Danish chef Ren\\u00e9 Redzepi at Noma in Copenhagen has risen to fame using local ingredients such as cloudberries, lichen or even forest moss that he then studs with stones and chocolates, a presentation that demands the diner ponder our foraging past and culinary future. The US chef Alice Waters offered a similar reframing at her restaurant Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, which is well-known for serving a lonely peach on an empty plate for dessert. In his book The Third Plate (2014), Dan Barber recalls his shock the first time he saw this. \\u2018I gasped because it was so crazy,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018The chefs lovingly cradled each peach on its way to the plate; the waiters ferried them away, walking gingerly.\\u2019 On the menu, the dessert was listed by the last name of its Californian farmer, David Mas Masumoto, and the fruit itself, the Sun Crest Peach. \\u2018I bit into it\\u2026 The juice ran down my face and chin\\u2026 It was the best peach of my life\\u2026 What Alice was saying was: Taste what Mas Masumoto created; I can\\u2019t do better.\\u2019 Because of that peach, and the way she served it, Barber stayed on to apprentice with Waters. Last summer, I stopped by a white-frame house on a curving, shady lane by Lake Allatoona in Georgia. A stately apple tree stood out front. The owner had set out a roadside stand with baskets of fresh Granny Smith apples laid upon white towels. I took 10 scarred, unpolished, unshining, lopsided green apples and left a dollar. I ate them all in a single day and went back for 10 more. Those apples were like the famed wrinkle in time that lets you step instantly across light years. I merged with my child self, tasting a tart and succulent fruit with indescribable base notes and top notes that I could never put into words. My apple. My childhood. My forgotten self. All commercial apples, including Granny Smiths, have been hybridised to a sugary monotone that has turned them into an Andy Warhol version of themselves, without the artist\\u2019s clever humour. I hate today\\u2019s apples. I am not a chef. I am not a curator of cuisines. I don\\u2019t read cookbooks. And yet I know exactly what Shields, Roberts, Barber and Adri\\u00e0 are after. I think we all do. \\u2018I don\\u2019t care if certain ingredients can only be paid for by plutocrats with bags of gold krugerands. As long as the ingredient is saved\\u2019 Shields puts it this way: \\u2018There is a group of us who want to know the deep flavours of what has endured longest. Those ingredients that mattered for so long that they became \\u201cthe taste\\u201d of the time, the points of reference against which all innovations were measured. For me, those ingredients constitute the canon, and the dishes of the time frame them.\\u2019 Purple straw wheat, for instance, was grown throughout the colonial South, and survived until the 1970s. Why was it a survivor and why did it nearly die? \\u2018It was a light sweet white winter wheat favoured for baking cakes,\\u2019 says Shields. Recently, it was boarded onto the global Ark of Taste, the register of the most endangered and historically important foods in the world, maintained by an organisation called Slow Food International. Says Shields: \\u2018Personally, I don\\u2019t care if certain of the ingredients that I bring back can only be paid for by plutocrats paying with bags of gold krugerands. As long as the ingredient is saved.\\u2019 But often that price isn\\u2019t obscene. Nat Bradford sells a packet of 12 watermelon seeds for $10 and donates the proceeds to his freshwater mission in Tanzania. Each watermelon that grows will produce hundreds of seeds, as will its progeny. On 19 April 2015, a popular antebellum cocktail was reborn: Brandy Smash, a mixture of Bradford watermelon molasses and watermelon brandy, syrup, water over crushed ice and an orange garnish. It was served at an interracial celebration for 80 diners held at McCrady\\u2019s Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, run by the Virginia-born chef Sean Brock. The feast honoured a freed slave named Nat Fuller, a celebrated Southern chef of the time. Fuller had hosted an interracial meal in 1865 to commemorate the end of the Civil War. The event was eventually lost to history, but Shields rediscovered Fuller in newspaper archives of the era, and his dinner honoured that important historical and culinary moment. The menu was true to the recipes of the time. According to the High Wire Distilling company\\u2019s owner Scott Blackwell, Brandy Smash was the hit of the bar. The Bradford had indeed returned, and Blackwell said the antebellum cocktail tasted like \\u2018pure summer in a glass\\u2019. \",\n          \"Here\\u2019s a story my father likes to tell. When I was five, my family spent several months living in Barbados. Since we were in a rental house, there weren\\u2019t many games or toys around, save for the beat-up travel checkers set we\\u2019d packed in our suitcase. The hours I didn\\u2019t spend in school learning to add a \\u2018u\\u2019 to the word color, or inspecting shells on the beach, I spent playing checkers, first with my family, and then, when they got sick of it, with the visitors who straggled through our cinderblock bungalow. One of them, a computer science professor, thought he\\u2019d humour my parents by playing with their sunburned kid. I destroyed him in two games. \\u2018I told you she was good,\\u2019 said my father. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the professor, \\u2018but the second game I was trying.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t remember this particular instance because it was unremarkable. I destroyed lots of people in checkers. The game turned out to be my gateway drug, and soon I began playing chess. Chess didn\\u2019t have the speed of checkers or the satisfying click the pieces made when you snapped one on top of the other and whispered: King me, but I liked that it had a story and characters and the ability to come back from near\\u2011annihilation in a few swift moves. So when my school offered a chess club in fourth grade, I promptly signed up. That first day we learned two endgame strategies. This was a whole new window onto the game: it was not a series of random moves, but rather the application of an already-established pattern. One merely needed to recognise the pattern, apply the strategy, set the trap and\\u2026 checkmate. I was so dazzled by the idea of an endgame, even by the very word endgame with its connotations of finality and apocalypse, that it took me until the third week to notice that I was the only girl in chess club. That was in 1980, and one might imagine that in the past 35 years the world has changed significantly vis-\\u00e0-vis girls and chess, but one would be wrong. As of May 2015, there are only two women who rank in the top-100 chess players worldwide. The United States Chess Federation states on its website that it has 85,000 members who are \\u2018predominantly male\\u2019. Scanning the \\u2018sex\\u2019 column on the World Chess Federation\\u2019s list of grandmasters is like reading a statistical overview of the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s bathroom lines at a tech conference \\u2013 of 1,479 grandmasters, 31 are women. That\\u2019s two per cent. Where are all the women chess players? Chess wasn\\u2019t always a male domain. In Birth of the Chess Queen (2004), the historian Marilyn Yalom describes a long line of female chess players stretching back through the centuries. In medieval Spain, women played chess in bed while recovering from childbirth. A French tale from 1230 tells of a knight who must win against an emir\\u2019s chess-master daughter in order to earn her hand. A school in 15th-century Germany, founded by a chess-loving bishop, taught girls and boys the game as part of the curriculum. Then, around the turn of the 17th century, women abruptly dropped out of the chess scene. Yalom hypothesises that this could have been related to changes in the game: the queen and bishop, both formerly weak pieces with limited movement, were now allowed to swoop terrifyingly across the board and dominate. Chess went from a leisurely game played between lords and ladies to a cut-throat competitive sport played in public houses and caf\\u00e9s, and therefore considered an unseemly activity for women. Whatever the reason, polite society has been murmuring the same message for more than 300 years: chess is not for women and, moreover, women are innately bad at it. In 1897, an article in American Chess Magazine noted that women\\u2019s chess games were subject to \\u2018illogical aberrations\\u2019 and suggested that the cause could be wire hairpins. In 1906, Lasker\\u2019s Chess Magazine explained the lack of female chess superstars as a natural outcome given women\\u2019s general lack of \\u2018qualities of concentration, comprehensiveness, impartiality and, above all, a spark of originality\\u2019. Chessworld\\u2019s 1964 spring issue featured an article by Norman Reider entitled \\u2018The Natural Inferiority of Women Chessplayers\\u2019. The US chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer was full of explanations for women\\u2019s chess shortcomings, most famously this one: \\u2018They\\u2019re all weak, all women. They\\u2019re stupid compared to men. They shouldn\\u2019t play chess, you know. They\\u2019re like beginners.\\u2019 This, from a man whose sister taught him to play the game. Lest these opinions be dismissed as old-fashioned, or the misogynist rantings of a madman, the most recent comment in this vein came just this April from the UK grandmaster Nigel Short, who encourages us to \\u2018gracefully accept it as a fact\\u2019 that men are simply \\u2018hardwired\\u2019 to be better chess players. Short was pummelled in the British press for his remarks; Twitter users wanted to know what to make of the fact that he\\u2019d been beaten by the Hungarian grandmaster Judit Polg\\u00e1r. But in his defence, Short was merely echoing something men have been saying for more than 100 years, his argument buoyed by the study \\u2018Explaining male predominance at the apex of intellectual achievement\\u2019 (2013). A solid explanation, Howard concludes, is that men are innately better at chess than women This study, by the psychologist Robert Howard, then at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, compares male and female performance in international chess, and finds that men consistently perform better than women, even when there are more women chess players. Howard claims that by looking only at top players, his study eliminates the issues of \\u2018glass ceilings and male gatekeepers downplaying female achievement\\u2019, as though these issues can be simply dismissed once a woman makes it to the upper echelons of the chess world. Howard also points out that in Georgia, a former-Soviet republic where 30 per cent of chess players are women, the performance gap still exists, though less so. A solid explanation, Howard concludes, is that men are innately better at chess than women. Howard has been conducting studies on the topic of male intellectual dominance for the past 10 years. His publications read like the reading list for a men\\u2019s empowerment club, with titles such as \\u2018Are gender differences in high achievement disappearing?\\u2019 (2005) \\u2013 not according to Howard \\u2013 and \\u2018Gender differences in intellectual achievement persist at the limits of individual capabilities\\u2019 (2013) \\u2013 ie men are smarter. But whatever Howard\\u2019s motivation, his study was an attempt to discredit the prevailing explanation for why there are so few women chess players at the top, which is that there are so few girls at the bottom. To this day, the number of parents who sign up their sons for chess lessons dwarfs the number of those who sign up their daughters. I studied the participant list at a recent elementary school-aged chess tournament that my kids played in on Manhattan\\u2019s Upper West Side, and found that boys outnumbered girls five to one. The NYChessKids programme, which runs classes throughout New York City, reports that while girls make up about half of their classes for preschoolers through to third grade, when it comes to tournaments, girls make up a quarter of players at most. One of those girls, at the moment, is my daughter, who has come to love the game through her chess-obsessed older brother. I\\u2019d always assumed my kids would learn the game just as I had, and I\\u2019d intended to start them out with checkers. When my son was three, I brought home a chess and checkers set, because if I had to play one more game of Candy Land I thought I might implode. I attempted to interest him in checkers, but he wanted to play only with the chess pieces. He was swept up in a love for the game before he even understood what the game was. He spent hours pretending to be chess pieces (you really haven\\u2019t fully experienced the glory of parenthood until you\\u2019ve watched your white three-year-old son run down a crowded street yelling \\u2018I\\u2019m a black queen!\\u2019), and began taking chess lessons at four. Our breakfast conversations sometimes include the phrase en passant and mentions of the Sicilian defence. It was into this environment that my daughter was born. She quickly grasped that there was something precious and holy about the black and white wooden pieces her brother spent so much time with \\u2013 for several months of preschool she insisted on bringing a \\u2018pet\\u2019 rook on a leash to school with her \\u2013 and eventually he taught her the game so he\\u2019d have a willing opponent at all times. So it was jarring to witness her, now six, marching into her first tournament surrounded by boys. Indeed, it wasn\\u2019t until I saw her blonde head bobbing in a sea of close-cropped hair that all those percentages began to mean something. The chess teachers and chess clubs I spoke with all report that, while the number of girls who start playing chess is increasing, and the percentage of females who are members of the US Chess Federation is at an all-time high, girls still tend to drop out at a furious pace. Some of that might be due to something called stereotype threat. In a 2013 study, the US psychologists Hank Rothgerber and Katie Wolsiefer found that girls as young as six are aware of the stereotype that \\u2018good chess players are usually boys\\u2019. Even worse, awareness of the stereotype affects the way girls play. The psychologists analysed data from 12 chess tournaments, and calculated expected winning percentages for different pairings. Because chess players are all rated by the US Chess Federation, this is a simple calculation to make \\u2013 a player with a 1000 rating is going to get smoked by a player rated at 2000, but has a fighting chance against one who is at 1100. Rothgerber and Wolsiefer found that when girls played against boys who presented a strong or moderate challenge, they lost more than they should have. Stereotype threat isn\\u2019t confined to kids. In a 2008 study, researchers at the University of Padua in Italy matched 42 expert female chess players with similarly ranked male opponents online. When the women weren\\u2019t told the gender of their opponent, or were told (incorrectly) that they were playing against another woman, they performed as expected. When they were told their opponent was male, they played dramatically worse. Which could partially explain why girls are quick to quit. If somewhere back in the recesses of your brain you believe that girls aren\\u2019t naturally gifted at chess, then working to improve at the game would be an exercise in futility. \\u2018By middle school, boys get very aggressive vocally. Girls don\\u2019t like it\\u2019 Stereotype threat is only one possible reason girls quit. One chess teacher I spoke with said that he\\u2019s had several female students with great potential quit in favour of more traditionally girl-approved activities such as horse riding and ice skating. Gary Ryan, the Vice President of NYChessKids, said he\\u2019s noticed that girls can also be put off by the hyper-competitive atmosphere that tends to develop in the tween years. \\u2018When they\\u2019re young, boys and girls both love chess,\\u2019 says Ryan. \\u2018But by middle school, boys get very aggressive vocally, like trash talking. Boys almost do that all the time. Girls don\\u2019t like it and aren\\u2019t into it.\\u2019 The aggression could begin even earlier. I recently observed my daughter playing against a slightly older boy at a chess tournament. Whenever he took a piece, he crashed the figure onto the board, the pieces making a loud clicking noise as though one had broken the other\\u2019s neck, then swooped up the conquered piece and slammed it down to the side of the board. Watching the game, I had to stifle the urge to shove a bishop up his nose. To her credit, my daughter brushed off the aggression, but I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder how long that will last. You\\u2019d have to be a pretty strong-willed teenage girl to handle being the only female in a room full of hormone-addled, trash-talking boys smashing knights and rooks around a chess board. And for those girls who have made it through the elementary-school years and into the more competitive chess world of middle and high school, even larger hurdles loom. Susan Polg\\u00e1r, sister of Judit and the world\\u2019s first female grandmaster, pointed out when we spoke recently that girls suffer from a Catch-22 when they begin to play chess more competitively. Because there are very few women at the upper levels of chess, there are very few female chess coaches. And because there are very few female chess coaches, there are very few girls who manage to make it to the next level in chess. The lack of women coaches presents two challenges. First, there\\u2019s a logistical issue. Coaches typically spend long hours with their prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9es, and many parents aren\\u2019t comfortable letting their teenage daughters hang out with some guy playing chess all day. Things get more complicated once coaches start to travel with players to tournaments, and logistical issues around hotel rooms and long weekends away from home crop up. Polg\\u00e1r also notes the economic issue: male coaches need a separate room from their female players, which doubles travel costs. But beyond the discomfort factor, Polg\\u00e1r also believes that boys and girls need to be coached differently, and that male coaches might find it difficult to understand a young girl\\u2019s mindset. \\u2018Boys are a lot more competitive naturally, so you don\\u2019t need to teach them to be competitive,\\u2019 she says. \\u2018Girls need to be coached to be more competitive.\\u2019 When people talk about how girls aren\\u2019t suited to chess, one of the first things they point out is that boys are supposedly more competitive or aggressive than girls. Nigel Short, before he announced that women weren\\u2019t wired to play chess, said they \\u2018just don\\u2019t have the killer instinct\\u2019. But there is a difference between being competitive and being aggressive. Multiple studies have shown that men are more physically and verbally aggressive than women, but studies around competitiveness have been inconclusive. And as anyone who survived middle school can attest, the world doesn\\u2019t lack for girls who like to win. I was curious about Susan Polg\\u00e1r\\u2019s assertion, so I asked Alexander Rasic, my son\\u2019s chess teacher and a man with more than 30 years\\u2019 coaching experience, whether girls needed to be taught to be competitive. He told me the following story: I have two daughters. One came out of her first chess tournament holding hands with the kid she\\u2019d been playing against. She said they\\u2019d decided to make it a tie and be friends. My other daughter, she\\u2019d beat her own grandmother.Killer instinct aside, studies have shown that men and women do have different styles of playing. A 2010 study found that, when a man is playing a woman, he\\u2019s likely to become even more aggressive than when he plays another man. Researchers at Stockholm University discovered that when strong male players were paired with strong female players, the men were more likely to open with an overly aggressive set of moves, which in the long run is a riskier and, the paper points out, \\u2018irrational\\u2019 strategy. And this difference shows up in kids too. Gary Ryan says the girls he\\u2019s taught tend to have a more subtle, less aggressive style of play, which indicates that they likely do need to be coached differently from boys. The prize money for the Women\\u2019s World Chess Championship is less than a third of the prize money for the World Chess Championship But regardless of coaching, studies show that the primary indicator of whether someone will become a good chess player is the level of interest in becoming a good chess player. Chess is a sport that requires hours of practice and study. And here is where girls and women face yet another hurdle. In order to want to succeed at something, there needs to be a strong motivating factor. For players who want to go pro, the incentives for men and women differ dramatically. The prize money for the Women\\u2019s World Chess Championship is less than a third of the prize money for the World Chess Championship. And, backing up for a moment, yes, there is a Women\\u2019s World Chess Championship. When I first heard that this existed, I wondered, absurdly, if there was something about chess that I\\u2019d been missing all these years that would require such a division. Were the pieces very heavy? Was there, in fact, something about women and chess that would require them, tennis-like, to compete separate from their male counterparts? It turns out that the division hasn\\u2019t been without controversy. The women\\u2019s championship is open only to women; the World Chess Championship, which is now open to men and women, is often referred to as the men\\u2019s championship. That\\u2019s because up until 1986 it was the Men\\u2019s World Chess Championship, a title that was cited as the reason for barring the first woman to qualify from competing in the tournament. (That woman was Susan Polg\\u00e1r.) Jennifer Shahade, a two-time US Women\\u2019s Chess Champion and the author of Chess Bitch (2005) and Play Like a Girl (2011), takes offence at the idea that there is anything wrong with women\\u2019s tournaments. \\u2018It\\u2019s not like women\\u2019s chess tournaments are an admission of inferiority, like women are saying we\\u2019re stupid so we\\u2019re playing in them,\\u2019 Shahade told me. But once chess players reach a certain level, it\\u2019s hard not to see the Women\\u2019s Chess Championship as the poor stepsister to the real action. The Women\\u2019s winner always ranks lower than the World Champion winner. Judit Polg\\u00e1r, the highest ranking woman in chess history, has refused to play in women\\u2019s tournaments throughout her career. Perhaps she hasn\\u2019t needed to. She\\u2019s defeated plenty of boldface chess names, including Garry Kasparov, Boris Spassky and Magnus Carlsen. She has also argued that, when girls play only against other girls, they end up limiting themselves and their ability to improve. Setting aside all the hurdles, why is it important that girls, and women, play chess? I could point to studies showing that playing chess improves reading scores and emotional intelligence. But there are also studies showing that playing chess has little impact on areas outside of chess. When parents sign up kids for lessons with Rasic, they\\u2019ll often ask which academic subjects they can expect their child to excel at. He tells them that he can\\u2019t guarantee that they\\u2019ll see improved academic performance; all he can guarantee is that their child will get better at chess. There might not be a direct correlation between playing chess and academic excellence, but there is undoubtedly a benefit to young girls learning that they can compete on the same intellectual playing field as boys. The opportunity to overcome stereotype threat is important practice for girls who might want to go into other fields rife with stereotypes about women, or simply as an opportunity to perform well when no one expects you to do so. And faith in one\\u2019s intellectual abilities can go a long way towards overcoming the soul-rattling feeling of being the only girl in the room, whether it\\u2019s at a chess tournament, or in a computer science class. It\\u2019s important that girls learn how to occupy space, and ultimately excel, in arenas that are typically viewed as too aggressive and competitive for the ladies. I work in technology, and the sinking feeling I had as I counted the number of girls at that recent chess tournament was nearly identical to the sinking feeling I\\u2019d had a year earlier at a pitch session for tech companies seeking funding. Every time my daughter notices a lack of girls or women in a field (her soccer club, the presidency, the Brooklyn Nets basketball team), we both experience an awkward moment of silence: a twinge like a paper cut for me, a reassessing of the world for her. I want her to grow up believing that girls can be anything, but the world often trumps my hand. Susan Polg\\u00e1r says change is coming, but it will be slow. She is retired from professional chess and runs a foundation aimed at fostering girls in the chess world. Any changes are too late for me. A week after discovering I was the only girl in my fourth-grade chess club, I quit. Since 1980, I\\u2019ve played only a handful of games. Today, even though chess is often being played in my house, I\\u2019m never a part of it. I relish playing all sorts of other smash-your-opponent types of games with my kids but I was never able to find my way back to chess.

They will also tell you that the best way to dry your wood is to chop it into short logs and arrange them in loose airy stacks somewhere that the wind can get at them. By weight, dry wood of all kinds releases roughly the same amount of energy when burnt, so the experienced hand knows to look for dry and dense wood and is not easily seduced by volume. I did not know these things until recently, but now that I do, this knowledge seems essential. It makes me a better man. Most of what I know about firewood comes from a Norwegian book entitled Hel Ved (2011), which roughly translates as \\u2018solid wood\\u2019. It was written by the novelist Lars Mytting and contains detailed discussions of every aspect of sourcing, chopping, drying, storing and burning wood. There are tables in the back listing the drying rates and percentage of ash you can expect from different species of tree. There are references to research conducted by something called the Norwegian Institute of Wood Technology. Mytting is serious about his firewood. This is the kind of book I knew I had to read before I had even seen a copy. I grew up in Norway, but now live in the UK. Fortunately, my parents could be convinced to send one to me, and I read it from cover to cover the weekend it arrived in the post. I have since studied parts of it as though preparing for an exam. This is not out of character. The book sits comfortably on my shelf next to a number of other, similar titles. One discusses, in exhaustive detail, the virtues of various flours when baking bread; another contains detailed instructions for constructing a back garden wood-burning oven; another still provides butchery instructions for every bird and mammal found on the British Isles, as well as some found only elsewhere. Collectively, they form a kind of eccentric survivalist reference library that takes up almost an entire Ikea Billy bookshelf. There are some individuals for whom such a reference library makes undoubted practical sense. If you live in an extremely rural community, some mastery of this knowledge is likely essential both for comfort and survival. I, on the other hand, live in central London. The two pigeons nesting in our chimney suggest that it is a long time since the disabled fireplace in our converted Victorian terrace last saw any action, and the local council would put an end to any aspirations I might have for a wood-burning oven in what can only with considerable generosity be called our back garden. There is, in short, perhaps some absurdity in my taste for survivalist literature. Mine is an emerging masculine ideal that requires a man to possess knowledge of a particular kind And yet I am not alone. I belong to a growing community of woodsmen, butchers and craftsmen of various kinds who ply their trade from the armchair. Hel Ved has sold more than 150,000 copies in a country with a population of just under five million, and has spent a year on Norway\\u2019s nonfiction bestsellers list. Following its success, Norway\\u2019s national broadcaster, which has a public service mandate similar to that of the BBC, aired a 12-hour television programme about firewood; one in five Norwegians watched at least part of it. An international audience also seems to have been captivated, with popular stories following on the BBC and in The New York Times. Evidently the audience for this kind of book extends well beyond the ranks of those to whom it might offer genuine practical value. A book such as Hel Ved is, in any case, not the portable and durable field-guide that the serious practitioner would require. These are weighty, fully illustrated tomes, designed for a coffee table. They are the reason the height of Billy bookshelves can be adjusted. What\\u2019s more, it will come as no surprise that much of this audience of armchair woodsmen are, like me, male. I belong to a demographic of young men who are increasingly hungry for the kind of knowledge these books supply, and who proudly display our survivalist libraries as a mark of status, rather in the way that young aristocrats once displayed their Grand Tour portraits. In addition to revealing much about firewood and butchery, my growing library therefore suggests something important about contemporary ideas of what it is to be a man. And as a philosopher, I find myself pondering the true nature of those ideas. \\u2018Hel ved\\u2019 means \\u2018solid wood\\u2019, but it is also a Norwegian expression denoting someone of a sound and reliable character. This translation gets much closer to explaining why Mytting\\u2019s book and others like it command my attention. They are as much about cultivating a certain kind of character as they are about their particular subject matter. In moments of reflection, I often find myself worrying that a real man knows some things that I do not. He knows how to go out in to the woods and return with usable firewood. He knows how to butcher a pheasant or a squirrel. He knows not just the ideals of nose-to-tail cooking, but the grisly mechanics as well. One reason I might want to know how to butcher a pig or to stack firewood is that I might be required to do so. Another is that I want to be a better man. Perhaps I am in the grips of the old, outmoded ideal of man as the provider, the hunter-gatherer. This is the vision of manhood embodied in Ernest Hemingway\\u2019s solitary heroes, forged through battle with noble adversaries in the deep ocean or on the plains of Africa, or, at the very least, in the bullring. Or perhaps I have been romanced by the same sirens that caught Henry David Thoreau\\u2019s ear and drove him away from the city and back to nature at Walden Pond. The particular ideal I have been preparing for, however, strikes me as both new and different from these predecessors, though each still survives in various forms. In the older cases, the knowledge the man requires plays what philosophers call an instrumental role. Both heroes have independent aims and aspirations, and knowledge is of value only to the extent that it can be enlisted in service of these independent aims. Many of us have opted instead to perform a kind of alchemy, transforming what was once of instrumental value into knowledge valued for its own sake The knowledge that I am pursuing, by contrast, appears to be a case of knowledge for its own sake. It will not make me any better at flourishing in my actual environment, or in an environment to which I secretly long to escape. It has almost no practical application in my life, but I desire it nevertheless. Though I do not mean to endorse it over others, or to exclude women, mine is an emerging masculine ideal that simply requires a man to possess knowledge of a particular kind. There are some things a man of this kind simply ought to know. And this new ideal has evolved, I think, fairly naturally from those that came before it. As a child I was taught how to whittle a bow and arrow from the soft pliable branches of early spring. My grandfather encouraged my cousin and me to make a flagpole from a recently felled tree. He taught us to carry a small knife at all times. I can still gut a fish or shell a crab with ease. These lessons were no doubt imparted because of their presumed instrumental value, and with the hope that they would serve me as they had served my teachers. Yet as the world I live in diverged from theirs, this instrumental value diminished and, in some cases, disappeared entirely. I could have abandoned this knowledge altogether. Not wanting to go this far, many of us have opted instead to perform a kind of alchemy, transforming what was once of instrumental value into knowledge valued for its own sake. But what sort of knowledge are we left with? A few months after the end of the Second World War, during which he had served as an intelligence officer, the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle made his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society in London. The paper he delivered was one of the first to draw a formal distinction between two different kinds of knowledge. Despite being a philosopher, Ryle appears to have been an eminently practical man. A former colleague of his once told me that his standard example of a good, virtuous activity was digging. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that Ryle saw himself as correcting an excessive intellectualism, one that he traced at least as far back as Plato\\u2019s tripartite division of the soul. In this view, there is a part of us that does the thinking, a part of us that does the doing, and what Ryle considered a mysterious \\u2018Janus-faced\\u2019 intermediary that connects the two, having its foot in both camps but resting in neither. Ryle found much to dislike about this picture. He noted, for example, that much of what we do \\u2014 such as chopping wood \\u2014 can be done intelligently or skilfully, as well as stupidly. According to the Platonic theory which he opposes, any intelligence exhibited in activity must be traced to the part of us that thinks. Doing something, like chopping wood, cannot itself be regarded as an exercise in intelligence. In the Platonic construction, chopping wood intelligently must be to chop wood while simultaneously performing a separate act of thought or theorising in which certain facts are contemplated in a way that guides the activity. Not all intelligence, or skill, or cunning, is expressed through thought. Some is expressed directly in action This picture, argued Ryle, is a mistake. The graceful dancer does not do two things at once, but rather one thing in a certain way. The same is true of the woodsman who chops wood intelligently. The intelligence is part of the performance and not separate to it. According to Ryle, intelligence can be exercised directly in certain kinds of practical performances. Not all intelligence, or skill, or cunning, is expressed through thought. Some is expressed directly in action. The same argument can be made by noticing that thinking and reasoning are themselves things that are done, and that they too can be done both cleverly and foolishly. In \\u2018What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\u2019 (1895), Lewis Carroll engages his characters in discussion of a simple argument consisting of two premises and a conclusion. The Tortoise challenges Achilles to show him how logic could ever force him to accept the conclusion of an argument. Achilles responds by stating that if the tortoise accepts his two premises, then he must also accept the conclusion. The Tortoise understands, but asks Achilles to make this step in his argument clear by writing it down and adding it as a third premise to his argument. \\u2018Very well,\\u2019 says Achilles, proceeding to restate his argument. If the tortoise accepts these three premises, then he must also accept the conclusion. Again the Tortoise understands, but again he asks Achilles if he should not add this statement as a fourth premise in his argument, since the Tortoise must accept the conclusion only if he accepts this further claim. At this point, Achilles sees that there is no end in sight. He can keep supplying premises indefinitely and the Tortoise can keep asking why. What went wrong, says Ryle, is that Achilles assumed that knowing how to reason consisted in the knowledge of some proposition that can be written down and placed alongside the other facts of his argument. This, as the Tortoise made plain, is not so. If those who follow Ryle are right, teaching someone how to reason does not consist in teaching some additional fact or premise. There are two kinds of intelligence at issue, each corresponding to the exercise of a different kind of knowledge. Ryle calls these two different forms of knowledge \\u2018knowing-that\\u2019 and \\u2018knowing-how\\u2019. The former is knowledge of propositions or facts: for example, knowing that the square root of 81 is nine, or that the army of the Ottoman Empire once reached the gates of Vienna. It can be written down and communicated through books, which might be why it comes most naturally to mind when we think of knowledge. Knowing-how, by contrast, is better thought of as a kind of skill or ability. It is the knowledge we exercise when we demonstrate that we know how to reason, or ride a bike, or swim. As the Tortoise purports to make clear, it cannot be reduced to knowledge of the first kind. Knowing how to reason or ride a bike does not consist in a series of facts that can be written down and presented to the Tortoise. It is knowledge of a different kind entirely. This is why, while there are many excellent books about bikes and cycling, there are few books that will teach you how to ride a bike. If Ryle is right (and there are those who deny it), the relation between knowledge and my masculine ideal is more complex than it first appears. To say that there are some things that a man must know is not yet to say what kind of knowledge they involve, nor yet how that knowledge might best be obtained. If knowledge-that is all that is needed, then Hel Ved and books like it offer a viable route to becoming the kind of man I want to be. If, on the other hand, the knowledge I value takes the form know-how, then there are limits to how successfully I can pursue it from the armchair. Given the origins of my ideal, it is most likely a combination of the two. Books can lead me part of the way, but they will leave both me and the Tortoise unsatisfied. If I truly aspire to knowing some of the things that were once essential to men like me, I must acknowledge that some of them \\u2014 some of the knowledge I now value for its own sake \\u2014 takes the form of know-how. Books will never capture this part of the ideal. Like men before me, I must at some point leave the armchair and head out into the woods. I have read, at least, that early spring is the time to go searching. \",\n          \"For the French philosopher Paul Virilio, technological development is inextricable from the idea of the accident. As he put it, each accident is \\u2018an inverted miracle\\u2026 When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution.\\u2019 Accidents mark the spots where anticipation met reality and came off worse. Yet each is also a spark of secular revelation: an opportunity to exceed the past, to make tomorrow\\u2019s worst better than today\\u2019s, and on occasion to promise \\u2018never again\\u2019. This, at least, is the plan. \\u2018Never again\\u2019 is a tricky promise to keep: in the long term, it\\u2019s not a question of if things go wrong, but when. The ethical concerns of innovation thus tend to focus on harm\\u2019s minimisation and mitigation, not the absence of harm altogether. A double-hulled steamship poses less risk per passenger mile than a medieval trading vessel; a well-run factory is safer than a sweatshop. Plane crashes might cause many fatalities, but refinements such as a checklist, computer and co-pilot insure against all but the wildest of unforeseen circumstances. Similar refinements are the subject of one of the liveliest debates in practical ethics today: the case for self-driving cars. Modern motor vehicles are safer and more reliable than they have ever been \\u2013 yet more than 1 million people are killed in car accidents around the world each year, and more than 50 million are injured. Why? Largely because one perilous element in the mechanics of driving remains unperfected by progress: the human being. Enter the cutting edge of machine mitigation. Back in August 2012, Google announced that it had achieved 300,000 accident-free miles testing its self-driving cars. The technology remains some distance from the marketplace, but the statistical case for automated vehicles is compelling. Even when they\\u2019re not causing injury, human-controlled cars are often driven inefficiently, ineptly, antisocially, or in other ways additive to the sum of human misery. What, though, about more local contexts? If your vehicle encounters a busload of schoolchildren skidding across the road, do you want to live in a world where it automatically swerves, at a speed you could never have managed, saving them but putting your life at risk? Or would you prefer to live in a world where it doesn\\u2019t swerve but keeps you safe? Put like this, neither seems a tempting option. Yet designing self-sufficient systems demands that we resolve such questions. And these possibilities take us in turn towards one of the hoariest thought-experiments in modern philosophy: the trolley problem. In its simplest form, coined in 1967 by the English philosopher Philippa Foot, the trolley problem imagines the driver of a runaway tram heading down a track. Five men are working on this track, and are all certain to die when the trolley reaches them. Fortunately, it\\u2019s possible for the driver to switch the trolley\\u2019s path to an alternative spur of track, saving all five. Unfortunately, one man is working on this spur, and will be killed if the switch is made. In this original version, it\\u2019s not hard to say what should be done: the driver should make the switch and save five lives, even at the cost of one. If we were to replace the driver with a computer program, creating a fully automated trolley, we would also instruct it to pick the lesser evil: to kill fewer people in any similar situation. Indeed, we might actively prefer a program to be making such a decision, as it would always act according to this logic while a human might panic and do otherwise. The trolley problem becomes more interesting in its plentiful variations. In a 1985 article, the MIT philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson offered this: instead of driving a runaway trolley, you are watching it from a bridge as it hurtles towards five helpless people. Using a heavy weight is the only way to stop it and, as it happens, you are standing next to a large man whose bulk (unlike yours) is enough to achieve this diversion. Should you push this man off the bridge, killing him, in order to save those five lives? A similar computer program to the one driving our first tram would have no problem resolving this. Indeed, it would see no distinction between the cases. Where there are no alternatives, one life should be sacrificed to save five; two lives to save three; and so on. The fat man should always die \\u2013 a form of ethical reasoning called consequentialism, meaning conduct should be judged in terms of its consequences. When presented with Thomson\\u2019s trolley problem, however, many people feel that it would be wrong to push the fat man to his death. Premeditated murder is inherently wrong, they argue, no matter what its results \\u2013 a form of ethical reasoning called deontology, meaning conduct should be judged by the nature of an action rather than by its consequences. The friction between deontology and consequentialism is at the heart of every version of the trolley problem. Yet perhaps the problem\\u2019s most unsettling implication is not the existence of this friction, but the fact that \\u2013 depending on how the story is told \\u2013 people tend to hold wildly different opinions about what is right and wrong. Pushing someone to their death with your bare hands is deeply problematic psychologically, even if you accept that it\\u2019s theoretically no better or worse than killing them from 10 miles away. Meanwhile, allowing someone at a distance \\u2013 a starving child in another country for example \\u2013 to die through one\\u2019s inaction seems barely to register a qualm. As philosophers such as Peter Singer have persuasively argued, it\\u2019s hard to see why we should accept this. Great minds have been wrestling with similar complexities for millennia, perhaps most notably in the form of Thomas Aquinas\\u2019s doctrine of double effect. Originally developed in the 13th century to examine the permissibility of self-defence, the doctrine argues that your intention when performing an act must be taken into account when your actions have some good and some harmful consequences. So if you choose to divert a trolley in order to save five lives, your primary intention is the saving of life. Even if one death proves unavoidable as a secondary effect, your act falls into a different category from premeditated murder. The doctrine of double effect captures an intuition that most people (and legal systems) share: plotting to kill someone and then doing so is a greater wrong than accidentally killing them. Yet an awkward question remains: how far can we trust human intuitions and intentions in the first place? As the writer David Edmonds explores in his excellent new book Would You Kill the Fat Man? (2013), a series of emerging disciplines have begun to stake their own claims around these themes. For the psychologist Joshua Greene, director of Harvard\\u2019s Moral Cognition Lab, the doctrine of double effect is not so much a fundamental insight as a rationalisation after the fact. In his latest book Moral Tribes (2013), Greene acknowledges that almost everyone feels an instinctual sense of moral wrong about people using personal force to harm someone else. For him, this instinctual moral sense is important but far from perfect: a morsel of deep-rooted brain function that can hardly be expected to keep up with civilisational progress. It privileges the immediate over the distant, and actions over omissions; it cannot follow complex chains of cause and effect. It is, in other words, singularly unsuitable for judging human actions as amplified by the vast apparatus of global trade, politics, technology and economic interconnection. Here, Greene\\u2019s arguments converge with the ethics of automation. Human beings are like cameras, he suggests, in that they possess two moral modes: automatic and manual. Our emotions are \\u2018automatic processes\\u2026 devices for achieving behavioural efficiency\\u2019, allowing us to respond appropriately to everyday encounters without having to think everything through from first principles. Our reasoning, meanwhile, is the equivalent of a \\u2018manual\\u2019 mode: \\u2018the ability to deliberately work through complex, novel problems\\u2019. If you can quantify general happiness with a sufficiently pragmatic precision you possess a calculus able to cut through biological baggage and tribal allegiances alike It\\u2019s a dichotomy familiar from the work of behavioural economist Daniel Kahneman at Princeton. Unlike Kahneman, however, Greene is an optimist when it comes to overcoming the biases evolution has baked into our brains. \\u2018With a little perspective,\\u2019 he argues, \\u2018we can use manual-mode thinking to reach agreements with our \\u201cheads\\u201d despite the irreconcilable differences in our \\u201chearts\\u201d.\\u2019 Or, as the conclusion of Moral Tribes more bluntly puts it, we must \\u2018question the laws written in our hearts and replace them with something better\\u2019. This \\u2018something better\\u2019 looks more than a little like a self-driving car. At least, it looks like the substitution of a more efficient external piece of automation for our own circuitry. After all, if common-sense morality is a marvellous but regrettably misfiring hunk of biological machinery, what greater opportunity could there be than to set some pristine new code in motion, unweighted by a bewildered brain? If you can quantify general happiness with a sufficiently pragmatic precision, Greene argues, you possess a calculus able to cut through biological baggage and tribal allegiances alike. The GMXO Compactable Car designed by Ali Jafari can be driverless. It stretches or compacts depending on parking and passenger requirements. Photo courtesy GMAutomation, in this context, is a force pushing old principles towards breaking point. If I can build a car that will automatically avoid killing a bus full of children, albeit at great risk to its driver\\u2019s life, should any driver be given the option of disabling this setting? And why stop there: in a world that we can increasingly automate beyond our reaction times and instinctual reasoning, should we trust ourselves even to conduct an assessment in the first place? Beyond the philosophical friction, this last question suggests another reason why many people find the trolley disturbing: because its consequentialist resolution presents not only the possibility that an ethically superior action might be calculable via algorithm (not in itself a controversial claim) but also that the right algorithm can itself be an ethically superior entity to us. For the moment, machines able to \\u2018think\\u2019 in anything approaching a human sense remain science-fiction. How we should prepare for their potential emergence, however, is a deeply unsettling question \\u2013 not least because intelligent machines seem considerably more achievable than any consensus around their programming or consequences. Consider medical triage \\u2013 a field in which automation and algorithms already play a considerable part. Triage means taking decisions that balance risk and benefit amid a steady human trickle of accidents. Given that time and resources are always limited, a patient on the cusp of death may take priority over one merely in agony. Similarly, if only two out of three dying patients can be dealt with instantly, those most likely to be saved by rapid intervention may be prioritised; while someone insisting that their religious beliefs mean their child\\u2019s life cannot be saved may be overruled. On the battlefield, triage can mean leaving the wounded behind, if tending to them risks others\\u2019 lives. In public health, quarantine and contamination concerns can involve abandoning a few in order to protect the many. Such are the ancient dilemmas of collective existence \\u2013 tasks that technology and scientific research have made many orders of magnitude more efficient, effective and evidence-based. If my self-driving car is prepared to sacrifice my life in order to save multiple others, this principle should be made clear in advance together with its exact parameters What happens, though, when we are not simply programming ever-nimbler procedures into our tools, but instead using them to help determine the principles behind these decisions in the first place: the weighting of triage, the moment at which a chemical plant\\u2019s doors are automatically sealed in the event of crisis? At the other end of the scale, we might ask: should we seek to value all human lives equally, by outsourcing our incomes and efforts to the discipline of an AI\\u2019s equitable distribution? Taxation is a flawed solution to the problem; but, with determination and ingenuity, brilliant programs can surely do better. And if machines, under certain conditions, are better than us, then what right do we have to go on blundering our way through decisions likely only to end badly for the species? You might hesitate over such speculations. Yet it\\u2019s difficult to know where extrapolation will end. We will always need machines, after all, to protect us from other machines. At a certain point, only the intervention of one artificially intelligent drone might be sufficient to protect me from another. For the philosopher Nick Bostrom at Oxford, for example, what ought to exercise us is not an emotional attachment to the status quo, but rather the question of what it means to move successfully into an unprecedented frame of reference. In their paper \\u2018The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence\\u2019 (2011), Bostrom and the AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky argued that increasingly complex decision-making algorithms are both inevitable and desirable \\u2013 so long as they remain transparent to inspection, predictable to those they govern, and robust against manipulation. If my self-driving car is prepared to sacrifice my life in order to save multiple others, this principle should be made clear in advance together with its exact parameters. Society can then debate these, set a seal of approval (or not) on the results, and commence the next phase of iteration. I might or might not agree, but I can\\u2019t say I wasn\\u2019t warned. What about worst case scenarios? When it comes to automation and artificial intelligence, the accidents on our horizon might not be of the recoverable kind. Get it wrong, enshrine priorities inimical to human flourishing in the first generation of truly intelligent machines, and there might be no people left to pick up the pieces. Unlike us, machines do not have a \\u2018nature\\u2019 consistent across vast reaches of time. They are, at least to begin with, whatever we set in motion \\u2013 with an inbuilt tendency towards the exponential. As Stuart Armstrong, who works with Nick Bostrom at the Future of Humanity Institute, has noted: if you build just one entirely functional automated car, you now have the template for 1 billion. Replace one human worker with a general-purpose artificial intelligence, and the total unemployment of the species is yours for the extrapolating. Design one entirely autonomous surveillance drone, and you have a plan for monitoring, in perpetuity, every man, woman and child alive. In a sense, it all comes down to efficiency \\u2013 and how ready we are for any values to be relentlessly pursued on our behalf. Writing in Harper\\u2019s magazine last year, the essayist Thomas Frank considered the panorama of chain-food restaurants that skirts most US cities. Each outlet is a miracle of modular design, resolving the production and sale of food into an impeccably optimised operation. Yet, Frank notes, the system\\u2019s success on its own terms comes at the expense of all those things left uncounted: the skills it isn\\u2019t worth teaching a worker to gain; the resources it isn\\u2019t cost-effective to protect: The modular construction, the application of assembly-line techniques to food service, the twin-basket fryers and bulk condiment dispensers, even the clever plastic lids on the coffee cups, with their fold-back sip tabs: these were all triumphs of human ingenuity. You had to admire them. And yet that intense, concentrated efficiency also demanded a fantastic wastefulness elsewhere \\u2013 of fuel, of air-conditioning, of land, of landfill. Inside the box was a masterpiece of industrial engineering; outside the box were things and people that existed merely to be used up.Society has been savouring the fruits of automation since well before the industrial revolution and, whether you\\u2019re a devout utilitarian or a sceptical deontologist, the gains in everything from leisure and wealth to productivity and health have been vast. As agency passes out of the hands of individual human beings, in the name of various efficiencies, the losses outside these boxes don\\u2019t simply evaporate into non-existence. If our destiny is a new kind of existential insulation \\u2013 a world in which machine gatekeepers render certain harms impossible and certain goods automatic \\u2013 this won\\u2019t be because we will have triumphed over history and time, but because we will have delegated engagement to something beyond ourselves. Time is not, however, a problem we can solve, no matter how long we live. In Virilio\\u2019s terms, every single human life is an accident waiting to happen. We are all statistical liabilities. If you wait long enough, it always ends badly. And while the aggregate happiness of the human race might be a supremely useful abstraction, even this eventually amounts to nothing more than insensate particles and energy. There is no cosmic set of scales on hand. Where once the greater good was a phrase, it is now becoming a goal that we can set in motion independent of us. Yet there\\u2019s nothing transcendent about even our most brilliant tools. Ultimately, the measure of their success will be the same as it has always been: the strange accidents of a human life. \",\n          \"He comes to the operating room late, greets no one, and berates the nurse for not setting up the stepstools the way he likes. He tells the resident she doesn\\u2019t know the anatomy and sighs when she adjusts her grip on a surgical tool. He slaps the hand of the medical student when she reaches for the retractor to pull back skin for a clearer view. The operating room is tense for hours. \\u2018I need a different clamp,\\u2019 he says at one point, \\u2018this one is too dull.\\u2019 \\u2018I\\u2019m on it,\\u2019 says the scrub nurse. \\u2018You\\u2019re not,\\u2019 he retorts, \\u2018or else it would already be in my hand.\\u2019 All of us adorned in blue scrubs and surgical caps stand on edge, braced against the next wrathful outburst. \\u2018I want to see the tip of my blades,\\u2019 the resident explains, staring intently at the monitors where her laparoscopic instruments have not quite come into view. \\u2018Just cut,\\u2019 the lead surgeon barks at her. By the end of the operation, the intern\\u2019s hand shakes as he sutures the wounds closed, to the beat of the running condescending commentary on his halting speed and less-than-perfect stitches. One doesn\\u2019t have to work in a hospital long to experience or observe some form of disrespect. This is hardly a secret. The bullying culture of medicine has been widely written about and portrayed in popular media. In one study, published in 2012 and conducted over the course of 13 years at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, more than 50 per cent of medical students across the US said they experienced some form of mistreatment. Behind closed doors, we share advice on whom to hang around and whom to avoid. At the start of my third year of medical school, when we would finally enter the hospital wards, we had an orientation: \\u2018Wear a raincoat,\\u2019 the doctor standing at the podium advised. I could expect to get rained on. For the most part, I\\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. The majority of doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals I\\u2019ve worked with have been courteous and respectful: strong teachers and compassionate caregivers. I have met colleagues whom I would feel honoured to work alongside in the future and mentors whom I\\u2019d want to treat my own family should they become ill. I\\u2019ve been amazed by residents who work 24-hour shifts and somehow still have the energy to teach those who do not yet know as much as they do. I both admire them and am grateful for them. But there is a reason those orientation warnings exist. The surgeon who chides the nurse for her inability to be in two places at once? The nurse who snaps at the medical student for reading the patient\\u2019s chart the same moment she wants to write it in? They are a substantial, troubling minority, and they can set the mood for the rest. Most of my friends in medicine have witnessed flagrant episodes of hospital bullying and have juicy tales to tell. But medical disrespect is usually far less dramatic, dished out in the form of \\u2018micro-aggressions\\u2019: exasperated sighs, a sarcastic tone, the dismissal of alternative ideas. It\\u2019s the subtle put-downs about a trainee\\u2019s competence that erode confidence; the public shaming for an incorrect answer on rounds; or the denial of simple privileges such as taking a chair or reading a chart. It\\u2019s the psychological effect of being called by your rank instead of your name, or having it made clear that your presence is a burden instead of a help. It\\u2019s being ignored. It\\u2019s other team members looking on when the disrespect occurs, afraid to challenge it and defend those lower on the totem pole. These are the acts that affect our state of mind in small but cumulative ways. This is the stuff that creates a culture. You learn to deal. This is how it is. That\\u2019s the system. It\\u2019s ingrained. You excuse bad behaviour with the platitude: \\u2018That\\u2019s just the way (s)he is.\\u2019 You appreciate from your elders that it could be much worse \\u2013 at least they can\\u2019t throw scalpels at you anymore. You make allies and whisper in solidarity with those in the trenches alongside you. You train yourself, just as they advised you on your very first day, to wear a raincoat. You start to wear it, and it becomes thicker as your training progresses. You add boots and an umbrella. Then, as you get better and more confident, perhaps you become impatient with the inevitable lack of expertise in the new trainees. Maybe in a few years, you start to rain on others. We\\u2019ve known for years that entering the ranks of medicine means developing a thick skin to criticism and being made to feel small. For a long time there was a mystique that this culture held everyone to high standards, and it was the price we paid for the care we got. What is disturbing is the increasing recognition that bullies are not only bad people to be around \\u2013 they\\u2019re bad doctors, too. Get admitted to any hospital, and you might notice that no longer is a single doctor on your case. Contrary to popular television scriptwriting, treating patients is rarely about the inspired intervention of one brilliant physician or surgeon. Rather, we work more like an ecosystem, with every organism in the hierarchy contributing to the whole. In the old days, interns straight out of medical school would man the hospital wards, see very sick patients, and learn to become doctors by practising on them. They\\u2019d experiment, they\\u2019d figure out stuff, and they\\u2019d grow. And sometimes, when they were wrong, patients would pay the price. Today, we still recognise that newly minted doctors must be trained, but there are more checks and balances in place for patient safety. Interns still see very sick patients and propose plans of action, but those plans are run by more experienced doctors before being implemented. In teaching hospitals, we meet on team rounds daily, discuss updates on patients, and talk through goals for the day. Questions get run by senior residents, and senior residents run things they\\u2019re unsure of by attending physicians. Whenever there is uncertainty, the question works its way up the hierarchy. At the same time, decision-making reports back down, so that the newest of the doctors carry out the plans and learn by doing. So far, so good \\u2013 this is a better system than it used to be. But it is also much more dependent on the communication and relationships among different members of the team. Now, enter the culture of disrespect. Suppose an attending physician makes withering critiques or unreasonable requests. A resident, hoping to avoid such abuse, slowly but surely starts to hold back. She holds back some questions for fear of burdening and, under the constant stress of being scolded, becomes immersed in details of efficiency. Whether she intends it or not, she gives off vibes of unavailability, spending hours hunched over a computer in the physician\\u2019s conference room cranking out progress notes and scheduling patient appointments. Meanwhile, a patient starts to take a turn for the worse, but it\\u2019s not completely clear-cut \\u2013 his vitals are just a bit off, his belly seems distended, and he complains of abdominal pain but is also known to the team as someone who complains. The nurse hesitates to voice her concerns to the resident, who is swamped doing paperwork and updating discharge summaries exactly the way the attending prefers. The patient continues to go downhill, and by the time word gets out the patient is much sicker \\u2013 and needs to be treated far more aggressively \\u2013 than would otherwise have been the case. A substantial body of data attributes medical errors to interactions among hospital workers. Calls for improved patient safety gained traction from the late 1980s through the early \\u201990s, when Australian researchers reported a shocking find: the vast majority of medical errors, some 70\\u201180 per cent, are related to interactions within the health care team. In the early 2000s, a report by the Joint Commission that accredits health care organisations in the US studied adverse events over a 10\\u2011year period and discovered that communication failure was the number-one cause for medication errors, delays in treatment, and surgeries at the wrong site. It was also the second leading cause of operative mishaps, postoperative events, and fatal falls. The link between harsh words and medical errors was reignited in 2012 when Lucian Leape, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Pub\\u00adlic Health, published a two-part series in Academic Medicine. \\u2018A substantial barrier to progress in patient safety is a dysfunctional culture rooted in widespread disrespect,\\u2019 Leape and his co-authors asserted. \\u2018Disrespect is a threat to patient safety because it inhibits collegiality and co-operation essential to teamwork, cuts off communication, undermines morale, and inhibits compliance with and implementation of new practices.\\u2019 It\\u2019s not that jerky personalities are reserved for those at the top. There are nice people and mean people at every rank. But in a system dependent on the proper functioning of hierarchy, it works like this: when anger and intimidation flow down, information stops flowing up. The chain of communication becomes clogged. In a system dependent on hierarchy, it works like this: when anger and intimidation flow down, information stops flowing up This information block goes beyond doctor-doctor interactions. In a now-classic, 1986 study by William Knaus and colleagues at the ICU Research Unit in Washington DC, communication between nurses and physicians was the single factor most correlated with increased mortality in hospital intensive care. Meanwhile, newer research by Alan Rosenstein and Michelle O\\u2019Daniel at the healthcare alliance VHA West Coast in California has identified a pervasive trend in which nurses are reluctant to call physicians \\u2013 even as a patient deteriorates. Some of the most popular reasons provided, according to their research? Intimidation. Fear of confrontation. Concerns about retaliation. In another study by Rosenstein and O\\u2019Daniel, nurses and physicians self-reported behaving badly in near-equal numbers. Most felt this behaviour resulted in increased errors, lower quality of care, and lower patient satisfaction. Seventeen per cent could name a specific adverse event that occurred as a direct result of disrespectful behaviour. When someone is unpleasant or demeaning, something switches in the minds of those on the receiving end: they sacrifice honest communication to save face. I\\u2019ve seen it in action so many times that the pattern has become predictable. Preoccupied with fear of appearing incompetent, team members keep uncertainties under wraps. Other times the opposite occurs. Annoyed that they\\u2019re being denigrated and prideful themselves, others fight back \\u2013 even when they\\u2019re unsure of the thing they\\u2019re fighting about. Once I saw two residents argue back and forth in front of the attending about a finding on a physical exam; the issue was unrelated to the patient\\u2019s illness, and the fight, a clash of egos, took mental energy and focus away from the patient\\u2019s needed care. Many in medicine actively protect the culture of disrespect because they hold a fundamentally flawed idea: that harshness creates competence Contrast that with cultures steeped in mutual respect. I\\u2019ve been on some truly outstanding medical teams that worked in opposite ways. Though everyone knew their place in the hierarchy, it also felt more egalitarian. Patients came before pride. The senior staff told others how to reach them and opened the lines of communication. Nurses attended morning rounds with the doctors; their input was valued and they were kept in the loop at every step. One night, we were on call with a \\u2018watcher\\u2019 \\u2013 that is, a patient who could take a turn for the worse quickly. The resident made clear her door was open \\u2013 literally and metaphorically. The nurses came by often and clarified orders. When the patient began to look even slightly ill, the nurse immediately got the doctor. They examined the patient together as the doctor explained what to do next and why. Questions were encouraged. Communication was crystal-clear. And the patient did well. Yet despite such outcomes, many in medicine actively protect the culture of disrespect because they hold a fundamentally flawed idea: that harshness creates competence. That fear is good for doctors-in-training and, by extension, good for patients. That public shaming holds us to higher standards. Efforts to change the current climate are shot down as medicine going \\u2018soft\\u2019. A medical school friend told me about a chief resident who publicly yelled at a new intern for suggesting a surgical problem could be treated with drugs. The resident then justified his tirade with: \\u2018Yeah, yeah, I know I was harsh. But she\\u2019s gotta learn.\\u2019 Arguments such as these run counter to all the data we have on patient outcomes. Brutality doesn\\u2019t make better doctors; it just makes crankier doctors. And shame doesn\\u2019t foster improvement; it fosters more mistakes and more near-misses. We know now that clinicians working in a culture of blame and punishment report their errors less often, pointing to fear of repercussion. Meanwhile, when blame is abolished, reporting of all types of errors increases. We can no longer deny the facts. Bad cultures lead to bad outcomes. Jerks do not make good medicine. They foster a backwards atmosphere that degrades trust, tarnishes open communication, and promotes cover-ups. Creating a culture of respect is not just about feeling good, for its own sake. It\\u2019s better for patient care. Pointing out dysfunction is easier than solving it. The million-dollar question is: does it have to be like this? And if not, how can it be improved? Some medical programmes are already taking steps to tackle disruptive interactions. A leader here, the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, began to address the problem as early as 1995; they created workshops and training sessions, established a Gender and Power Abuse committee, and developed mechanisms to accept confidential reports of mistreatment. More recently, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston developed a model for team restoration following disruptive interactions. Programmes to spot and eliminate disrespect work well with one-time instances of explosive behaviour. But from my experience, the worst offenders are serial offenders. That some have made it to the top of the food chain suggests there was no sufficient deterrent for behaving that way. That must change. Medical trainees are already evaluated on many qualities these days. The powers-that-be can prioritize respectful behavior on that list. If we evaluate and ultimately promote trainees on honest communication and keeping their egos in check, we\\u2019ll cultivate good behaviour from the start. We can\\u2019t ignore a system that takes loads of formerly \\u2018nice\\u2019 people and churns out jaded, bitter, and gruff ones At the same time, change should emerge from within the hospital itself. Instead of looking away sheepishly when our colleagues are mistreated and apologising for bad behaviour with tired mantras, we should push back. Bullies have ripple effects. Medical students mimic the behaviour of residents who mimic the behaviour of attendings until a problem with attitude can extend from a few people to an entrenched culture. Instead of riding that wave, we could shun bad behaviour. This is easier said than done. But cultures change because people within commit to changing them; it won\\u2019t come by decrees. A culture that shames bullying makes the bully look like the bad guy, rather than making the recipient look weak. In a similar vein, we should put an end to the premium that the medical establishment places on saving face. This is a hazard. It feeds the egotistical environment that can lead to ignoring input and failing to ask for help. It creates doctors who value looking like they know what they\\u2019re doing at all times more than actually doing what is best. Finally, we should be getting to the root of the behaviour. Why do people behave badly? Some are just jerks. Some imitate jerks. But we also can\\u2019t ignore a system that takes loads of formerly \\u2018nice\\u2019 people and churns out jaded, bitter, and gruff ones. We have to call attention to the external factors that can contribute. The lack of sleep. The poor hours. The system that overbooks and overworks. Environments such as these persist in part because of our unique vantage point in taking care of others at some of the worst points in their lives. How can I say \\u2018I\\u2019m tired\\u2019 or \\u2018I\\u2019m hungry\\u2019 or \\u2018He hurt my feelings\\u2019 in the face of such profound human suffering? Yet it\\u2019s hardly absurd to ask for better working conditions. When working in a system that treats us all humanely, we\\u2019re more likely to be humane to each other, and to our patients. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input_ids\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attention_mask\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Set up the Evaluator.**"],"metadata":{"id":"bv9DFKwNM4GE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rouge = evaluate.load(\"rouge\")\n","bertscore = evaluate.load(\"bertscore\")\n","perplexity = evaluate.load(\"perplexity\")\n","\n","def computeMetrics(evalPred):\n","  '''Function compute evaluation metrics. evalPred is a tuple given:\n","  evalPred[0]: Model-generated predictions -- token IDs of the generated summaries.\n","  evalPred[1]: Ground truth labels (references aka.
